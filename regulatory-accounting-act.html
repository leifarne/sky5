<h2 id="accounting-act">Accounting Act </h2>
<p>According to the Norwegian Accounting Act section 13 second paragraph
accounting materials must be stored in Norway for five years after the
end of the accounting year. Some documentation may be deleted after
three and a half years.</p>
<h3 id="the-types-of-data-that-need-to-be-stored-in-norway-are">The
types of data that need to be stored in Norway are:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The yearly accounts and other mandatory account reports, yearly
report and audit report,</li>
<li>Specifications to accounts and reports mentioned in (1)</li>
<li>Documentation for the data in the accounts and deleted data,
documented control trail and the balance,</li>
<li>Numbered letters from the auditor,</li>
<li>Agreements regarding the company, except agreements of “lesser
importance”,</li>
<li>Correspondence that provides significant additional information to
data in the accounts,</li>
<li>Content slips or other similar documentation accompanying goods, or
sent to the byer in other ways,</li>
<li>Mandatory price overviews required by laws or regulations.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an exception, the current regulation concerning
<strong>bookkeeping accept digital storage in the Nordic
countries</strong> (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland) without having
to apply for an exception, provided that the <strong>following
conditions are met</strong>;</p>
<ul>
<li>the accounting records stored abroad must be available in readable
form in Norway,</li>
<li>they must be printable during the entire storage period from a
terminal or similar in Norway.</li>
<li>Similarly, the control authorities cannot be denied access to the
accounting records, and the Directorate of Taxes must be informed in
writing of the storage and certain details, including information
regarding which parts of the accounting records are being stored abroad,
including specifications, what kind of information etc.</li>
<li>The written notice must also include the company name and address
where the server is located, and information on how the control
authorities may access the data at any time.</li>
<li>The storage duration must satisfy the terms in the Norwegian
Accounting Act, regardless of the local regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a limited possibility to apply for exception for
storage in other EEA countries, if you are a part of a corporation which
have an accounting data solution that stores data outside the Nordic
countries and you as an affiliated is obliged to use such solution. To
be granted such dispensation from the Directorate of Taxes, it must be a
problem for the enterprise with a bookkeeping obligation to meet the
legal requirement to store said records in Norway. In this case, the
Directorate of Taxes does not consider cost savings gained by foreign
storage to constitute an independent basis for dispensation. Where
dispensation has been granted so far, the deciding factor is whether
storage abroad is part of a common accounting solution within a group
company or similar amalgamated entities, and that the storage is taking
place in a group company or similar abroad or under the control of such
a company. They have also placed emphasis on whether the data is stored
in a country with which Norway has entered into a tax treaty.
Furthermore, there is a condition that accounting records stored abroad
must be available in readable form in Norway, and that they can be
printed during the entire storage period from a terminal or similar in
Norway. Similarly, it is a condition that control authorities cannot be
denied access to the accounting records.</p>
<p>If you need to use a cloud solution that stores accounting data
outside the Nordics, and you do not qualify for the abovementioned
exception, he most common mitigation is to make a read-only export of
this data and store it on some secured (against destruction, loss or
alteration) server or media in Norway. It needs to be available for
audits during the whole storage period, in a form that the Tax Authority
may process.</p>
<p>Dette betyr således at den løpende bokføringen kan godt skje på en
løsning i utlandet. Men innen en måned etter fastsetting av
årsregnskapet og senest sju måneder etter regnskapsårets slutt overfører
regnskapsmaterialet til oppbevaring i Norge. En bør således tilstrebe å
velge løsninger med eksport eller arkivmulighetene, som muliggjør
dette.</p>
<p>We do expect that this requirement will be abolished within a few
years, due to Regulation 2018/1807 on a framework for the free flow of
non-personal data in the European Union. As a non-EU EEA country, this
Regulation is not in force yet in Norway, and it is difficult to tell
exactly when it will come into effect. We are monitoring the
developments here.</p>
