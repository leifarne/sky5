<h1 id="nve">NVE</h1>
<p>NVE is responsible for coordinating the work on preventive security
and emergency preparedness in the power supply. NVE administers and
relies on six laws associated with regulations in various areas for its
work.</p>
<p>The Energy Act and the Power of Supply Preparedness Regulations are
particularly important in connection with cloud services. However, there
are no specific regulations or prohibitions on the use of cloud services
in power grid operations in neither the Energy Act nor the Power of
Supply Preparedness Regulations.</p>
<p>What is worth emphasizing is the use of cloud services in
KBO-entities. According to the Power of Supply Preparedness Regulations
section 2-1 second paragraph, KBO-entities means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The business that owns or operate facilities, systems, or
other</p>
<blockquote>
<p>infrastructure, and which are classified according to this regulation
under section 5-2 or section 5-7, or</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Other businesses that the emergency preparedness authority has
&gt; determined to be KBO-entities pursuant to section 3-1 second &gt;
paragraph.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are no specific regulations of cloud services in law or
regulation, either generally or for KBO-entities. However, the Power of
Supply Preparedness Regulations limit to some extent the use of cloud
services by KBO-entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Requirements for system documentation</li>
<li>Control over system changes</li>
<li>Access control</li>
<li>Operation and maintenance</li>
<li>Supervision</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, it is relevant to emphasize what KBO-entities can use cloud
services for. This can be divided into two main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information</li>
</ul>
<p>Power-sensitive information. Power-sensitive information is defined
in section 6-2 and refers to specific and detailed information about the
power supply that could be used to damage facilities, systems, or other
infrastructure or affect functions that are significant for the power
supply, including the items in letter (a) to (j) which provide a
non-exhaustive list of what power sensitive information can be.</p>
<p>According to the Power of Supply Preparedness Regulations the
KBO-entities have the responsibility for identifying power-sensitive
information, as well as controlling the overview of location and access.
This means that the KBO-entities must have control over where
power-sensitive information is located, as well as control over cloud
provider and subcontractor’s access.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the customer must ensure that they, when outsourcing
services, have measures, routines, and systems as described in section
6-3. If cloud services are to be used and they process sensitive
information, special considerations apply to ensure that confidentiality
is maintained. This can also be derived from section 9-3 second
paragraph of the Energy Act, which required the signing of a
confidentiality statement.</p>
<p>The service and all its components <strong>should</strong> be
process, store and transport within EFTA, EU or NATO. Often it is
possible to demand and obtain approval that all data centers involved
should be located withing EFTA, EU or NATO. However, if the data center
is to be located outside of EFTA, EU or NATO, a risk assessment should
be conducted, including country risk.</p>
<p>As a main rule KBO-entities can use cloud services for personal data,
however it is subject to certain conditions. However, the use of cloud
services for personal data may have challenges outside EEA. The exact
boundary for such data is unclear, and it must therefore be assessed
concretely in each individual case.</p>
<p>Other information. As a main rule, KBO-entities can use cloud
services for other information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Function</li>
</ul>
<p>Operational control systems. As a main rule KBO-entities cannot use
sky services for Operational control systems, including SCADA. The clear
starting point is therefore that such use is prohibited. In extension of
this, adjacent or interacting systems can be problematic in relation to
the use of cloud services.</p>
<p>When it comes to other systems, such as DMS, ERP, 0365 etc., it is
generally allowed, unless there are specific restrictions or limitations
set by the owner of the system or the service provider.</p>
<p>Given the above, as well as the report “Regulering av IKT-sikkerhet"
(Regulation of ICT-security) prepared by NVE and the Security Guidelines
for power-sensitive information in cloud services, several factors
should be taking into consideration when evaluating cloud services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ownership of data through clear regulations. Note that the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>customer’s information should not be used by the provider for their
own purposes or shared with other parties without the customer’s
consent. This also applies to metadata about the customer’s
information.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The customer shall have updated backups of necessary information,
&gt; software and configurations of the operating control system that
&gt; are essential for the operation, safety, and recovery of power &gt;
supply. The backups shall be stored remotely in a secure location &gt;
that is easily accessible for the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirements for cloud providers to have certifications. Even
though</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cloud providers are often certified according to recognized
international standards for information security, the customer should
explicitly ask about this.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The loss of encryption keys can have critical consequences, as
it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>will lead to the loss of encrypted information. Therefore, good
technical solutions are important.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>An exit strategy that outlines how data can be brought back to
the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>company's own or another data center if desired. This may be
necessary if the provider is acquired and the service offering changes.
Financial and practical issues must be clarified, including transaction
costs associated with changing suppliers should be included in the
calculations.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The customer should have access to third-party audit reports
for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oversight of the provider.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Requirements for the customer to be notified if unwanted
incidents &gt; occur and the data is compromised.</p></li>
</ul>
