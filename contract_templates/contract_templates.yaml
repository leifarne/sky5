title : Contract Templates
text : |-
    Below you find contract templates for the most common types of resale of Microsoft Online-services. There are two templates for resale of Azure Online-services as a CSP, and two templates for SaaS providers hosting its application in Azzure. For all templates, we have incorporated what we have deem to be necessary regulations, to be compliant with either Microsoft Partner Agreement for CSP resellers, or MCA/EA or MOSA if you are a SaaS provider hosting in Azure.
    
    You can see all relevant Microsoft risk and obligations we have considered by using the filter "Customer" under Detailed Walkthrough or under Risk Assessment Tool. As you will see, this extends beyond merely just flowing down the MCA to end-customers when you are a CSP, as the Microsoft Partner Agreement has many obligations towards you as a reseller which you need to mirror against your end-customers, that are not covered in the MCA. You should do your own assessment of the "flow down" as our selection is basesd on commercial assessments, and may leave some residual risk on you.
