<h1>Reselling Azure vs AWS vs GCP</h1>

<p> As you will see when you go through our detailed review of the reseller agreement for Microsoft, Amazon and Google
    respectively, their respective resales models are to some extent similar but also very different. </p>

<p> A similarity is extensive documents and regulations, making it challenging to understand the full picture. </p>

<p> A major issue is that the resale models between the hyperscalers differ quite a bit. As mentioned under <a
        href="being-a-cloud-reseller.html">Being a Cloud Reseller</a>, there are to main resale models:</p>
<ol>

    <li>end-customers acceptance of the cloud supplier’s subscription terms establishes a direct agreement between the
        end-customer and the cloud supplier, and you as a reseller are normally not liable for any breach of such
        subscription
        terms by end-customers,</li>

    <li>end-customer does not have to accept the cloud suppliers subscription terms in a way that establishes a direct
        agreement
        between end-customer and the cloud supplier and you as the reseller will be held liable by the cloud supplier
        for any
        end-customer breach of said terms.</li>
</ol>

<p> We also see a lot of difference in the “balance” of the terms and conditions. </p>
