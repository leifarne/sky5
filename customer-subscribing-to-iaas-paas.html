    When
    subscribing to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a
    Service (PaaS) from the hyperscalers, you normally need to accept their
    standardized subscription terms.</h3>
<p>We will guide you through the subscription terms for
    <strong>Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud
        Platform</strong>, so you understand your rights and obligations.
</p>
<p>Our comparison basis is a traditional sourcing/hosting agreement, and
    how the balance in the cloud subscription agreements may differ. A
    high-level summary of the differences is that the subscription
    agreements lack <strong>“predictability” from a customer
        perspective</strong>, at least if you focus on <strong>business
        continuity.</strong></p>

    There
    are however some ways to mitigate this risk. The risk is also affected
    by several other factors than merely the subscription terms as
    such.</h3>
<h2 id="different-programs-may-have-different-protection.">1. Different
    programs may have different protection.</h2>
<p>If you purchase cloud services directly from the hyperscalers, you
    may purchase under different programs. For Azure, you may for instance
    subscribe under their Enterprise program (EA) (if you have 500
    subscription licenses or more, and are a public customer), under their
    “new” Customer Agreement program (MCA) or under their Microsoft Online
    Services Agreement program (MOSA). For each of the hyperscalers we will
    guide you through the various programs benefits or potential
    drawbacks.</p>
<h2 id="subscription-through-a-reseller-may-affect-your-rights-and-obligations.">2.
    Subscription through a reseller may affect your rights and
    obligations.</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, when you buy cloud services from a hyperscaler
    through a reseller, you normally need to accept the hycperscalers
    subscription terms, through the agreement you sign with the
    reseller.</p>
<h2 id="a-key-element-here-is-which-contractual-consequence-this-has-for-you-as-a-customer">A
    key element here, is which contractual consequence this has for you as a
    customer:</h2>
<h3
    id="if-acceptance-of-the-hyperscalers-subscription-terms-has-the-contractual-consequence-that-you-in-reality-enter-into-a-direct-agreement-with-the-relevant-hyperscaler-in-addition-to-the-separate-resale-agreement-with-the-reseller">
    <strong>If
        acceptance of the hyperscalers subscription terms has the contractual
        consequence that you in reality enter into a direct agreement</strong>
    with the relevant hyperscaler (in addition to the separate resale
    agreement with the reseller):
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This means that you can enforce your rights directly towards the
        hyperscaler, and visa versa.</li>
    <li>The reseller will not be a contractual party to such agreement, will
        not be a part of any disputes or claims for damages for instance if the
        cloud service is defective etc, except if related to payment for
        consumed cloud services.</li>
    <li>In such set-up you normally agree the subscription fee with the
        reseller and pay the reseller. This way of buying through a reseller,
        does not add any specific risks from a customer perspective, in addition
        to the subscription terms in itself, except that you may loose access to
        the cloud services if the reseller agreement for some reason is
        terminated. This since your account often is tied up to and dependent on
        the technical solutions of the reseller.</li>
    <li>
        As for the latter, there are also different reseller “tiers” and for some,
        we see that termination of the reseller agreement under some “tiers” has
        the consequence that the reseller loses its right to resell to existing
        customers from one day to the other, while under other “tiers” the
        reseller will be entitled to continue to deliver to existing customer
        for a transitional period from 1 month to a year depending on the
        hyperscaler and the programs. Such differences may affect you as a
        customer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>If acceptance of the subscription terms does not create a direct
    agreement between you as a customer and the relevant hyperscaler, but
    you will normally still be contractually obliged to adhere to the
    subscription terms (is normally agreed in your agreement with the
    reseller) because the reseller is liable towards the hyperscaler for any
    breach of such terms by its end-customers. Such models are also
    frequently used, but we then see that the rights for the customers are
    weakened. For instance:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The few rights the customer has according to the terms and
            conditions in the subscription terms, are not rights granted to
            you
    </li>
    <li>
    The obligations remain, since the reseller have no choice other
            than mirroring such against you (because the reseller is liable towards
            the hyperscaler for any breach of such terms by its
            end-customers)
    </li>
    <li>
        As there will be no direct agreement, you will not be offered a
            normal third-party infringement indemnity from the hyperscaler
    </li>
    <li>
        And there are for several of the hyperscalers a potential “domino
            effect”, where you are compliant with the Hyperscalers T&amp;C’s, but
            where other customers are not, and then this may lead to suspension or
            termination towards you as well.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
<p>So ask your potential reseller to inform you of whether such risks exist or not.</p>
