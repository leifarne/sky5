## Health Registry Act / Patient Records Act / Health Personnel Act (The Health Norm)

The Government, the Norwegian Directorate of eHealth, as well as the
supervisory authorities agree that cloud services can be used for
processing personal data, including **special categories of personal
data.**

The Health Registry Act, the Patients' Records Act and the Health
Personnel Act impose a number of requirements on the processing of
health information. 

### In the following, a brief overview of relevant
regulations within the healthcare sector will be provided. These are
rules that must be taken into consideration when entering into
agreements on cloud services.

## The Health Registry Act

The Act applies to 
          "all processing of health information for statistics, health analyses, 
          research, quality improvement, planning, management, and preparedness
          in the health and care administration and the health and care services" 
          in accordance with section 3 first paragraph.
          
The Act also applies to information that is **confidential under section 21 of the Health Personnel Act,** as far asthey are applicable, but it does not apply to the processing of health
information regulated by the Health Insurance Act or the Patient Records
Act.

According to the Health Registry Act section 4 the Act applies to data
controllers **established in Norway**. However, when processing health
information in companies (data controllers) established outside of
Norway, but within a country in **EU or EEA**, the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) apply. Companies **outside the EU or EEA** must also
follow the rules of the GDPR if they offer goods and services to EU or
EEA citizens, or if they track the behavior of EU or EEA citizens within
the EU or EEA, cf. Article 3.

When it comes to the availability of health information to foreign
countries, it is relevant to take a closer look at the provisions in the
**Patient Records Act section 19 and the Health Registry Act section
19a.**

Regarding agreements for the establishment of cloud services, the
government has particularly emphasized the importance of the fact that
the chosen solution must meet the customer's requirements for
**information security**. The Health Registry Act section 21 requires data
controllers and data processors to implement technical and
organizational measures to archive a level of security that is
appropriate to the risk. The provision is in line with what is stated in
the General Data Protection Regulation **(GDPR) article 32**. It is worth
noting that the data processor is subject to obligation under these
provisions. Cloud services are therefore covered by the provision.

In addition to the requirements in GDPR Article 32, the provision in
section 21 specifies that the requirement for information security also
includes access control, logging, and subsequent control. This is to
ensure that health information in the systms is always up to date,
correct, and only accessible to those who need the information. Further,
section 21 also states that personal identifying characteristics shall
be stored encrypted in health registers that are authorized under
section 10 or 11. Encryption is a security measure that must be
considered in conjunction with the other security measures.

## The Patient Records Act

In accordance with section 3 first
paragraph, the Act applies to "all processing of health information
necessary to provide, administer or ensure the quality of health care
for individuals". This implies that it concerns sensitive information
that must be disclosed to the general public.

Section 6 sets requirements for a legal basis to make it legal to
process health information in treatment-oriented health registers. The
word "treatment-oriented health registers" is defined in section 2
letter d.

_Confidentiality, cf. § 15 _

Like the Health Security Act, the Patient Records Act contains a
provision regarding information security in section 22. The provision is
formulated similarly but does not contain the specific rule on
encryption of personally identifiable characteristics in health
registers authorized under section 10 or 11.

- Risikovurdering av skytjenesten som skal brukes. Må treffes
-  nødvendige sikerhetstiltak for å sikre at helseopplysningene beskyttes tilstrekkelig.

- Ulike perosnvernregler I ulike land, skaper usikkerhet rundt hvor dataene faktisk blir lagret og behandlet. Gjelder særlig hvis skytjenesten befinner seg utenfor EØS, hvor personvernreglene kan være annerledes.

## The Health Personnel Act

- Forsvarlighetskrave § 4

- Taushetsplikten § 21 (fulgt opp I pasientjournalloven § 15)

- Journalføringsplikten § 39

- Bestemmelsen om informasjonssikkerhet I helseregisterloven vil
  gjelde tilsvarende.



           Overall, and in the light of relevant regulations in the healthcare
         sector, it is important for each customer to clarify what kind of data
          they process, and what data they want to process in a clous solution
