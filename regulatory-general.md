## General

As a Customer of cloud services, you should not only review the relevant hyperscalers subscription terms and conditions to have control over your rights and obligations.

Depending on the business sector you operate in, there may also be **various laws and regulations you need to have control over**, and that you need to be compliant with when using cloud services. This extends **beyond GDPR.** 

We therefore also provide an overview of regulatory requirements applicable to the average customer: 
 - The Accounting act
 - The Archives act
 - The GDPR (data privacy) 
 
 And to a large extent also sector specific legislation, such as: 
 - European Banking Association guidelines for bank and finance 
 - EIOPA for insurance
 - NVE rules for energy
 - The Health Registry Act for hospitals etc. 
 
In addition to such overview, we translate what it means that the **Cloud T&Cs should state/give you as rights as a customer**, in order to be compliant. 

In addition to the regulatory overview you get, our risk assessment tool is configurable for different customer sectors, so if you for instance are a bank you can choose that compliance with EBA guidelines should be a part of the tool, so you can use that to assess/document compliance.
