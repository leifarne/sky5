<h1 style="text-align:center;"> What you need to know about reselling cloud services?</h1>

<p><strong>Reselling cloud services can be complex. As a reseller you (and your clients) are 
exposed to a range of obligations from Microsoft, AWS or Google, and it can be difficult 
to get an overview of your numerous rights and obligations.</strong></p>

<p><strong> The Basics</strong></p>
 
<p>
To become a reseller, you will need to enter into a reseller/partner/solution provider 
agreement with the cloud service provider. This will authorize you to resell, but these 
agreements have a complex range of obligations and risk allocations. It can therefore 
be difficult to properly understand, assess and mitigate the potential risks for you 
and your clients. 
</p>
<p>
You will need to establish routines to ensure compliance, and there are "rules of engagement" 
to ensure that you resell the cloud services in accordance with the terms and conditions. 
On top of this, the rules of engagement vary between cloud suppliers.

This has the <strong>advantage</strong> for you that any <strong>breach by
    end customer</strong> of the customer agreement is normally <strong>handled directly</strong>
    between <strong>end customer</strong> and the <strong>cloud supplier</strong>. With exception that you
    as reseller will always be <strong>obliged to pay</strong> the applicable cloud
    supplier for any end customer cloud services consumption, you will
    <strong>not be liable</strong> towards the applicable cloud supplier for any damages 
    due to breach by your end customers. At least as long as you have ensured
    that the end customer has accepted the applicable cloud supplier's
    customer agreement. This way of reselling is often combined with end
    customer <strong>unique tenants</strong>, belonging to the end customer.

<p>
Often this way of <strong>reselling</strong> does not
    give the end customer a unique tenant, and is often used by <strong>SaaS
    suppliers</strong> offering <strong>multitenant solutions</strong> or similar, but also exists
    as resale models for <strong>IaaS/PaaS</strong>. Some cloud suppliers do not require
    you to enter into a reseller agreement as such in order to resell
    this way, you can merely be a "normal" customer and resell (for
    instance using <strong>Microsoft Hosting exception</strong>).
