<h1>Being a Reseller of Cloud Services </h1>

<p><strong>As a reseller of cloud services from Microsoft, AWS or Google, it is important to have 
control over your rights and obligations.</strong> </p>

<p>
In order to
become a reseller, you normally need to enter into a
reseller/partner/solution provider agreement which will authorize you to
resell. Such agreements have a lot of obligations and risk allocations 
you need know of so you can assess it and mitigate potential risk, obligations
where you should establish routines to ensure compliance of such, or other 
"rules of engagement" you need to know of to ensure that you resell the cloud 
services in accordance with such terms and conditions.
</p>

<h2>How the rules of engagement are, varies a bit from cloud supplier to cloud supplier. </h2>

<p>Generally speaking you can distinguish between a resale model where:</p>

<p>
This has the <strong>advantage</strong> for you that any <strong>breach by
    end customer</strong> of the customer agreement is normally <strong>handled directly</strong>
    between <strong>end customer</strong> and the <strong>cloud supplier</strong>. With exception that you
    as reseller will always be <strong>obliged to pay</strong> the applicable cloud
    supplier for any end customer cloud services consumption, you will
    <strong>not be liable</strong> towards the applicable cloud supplier for any damages 
    due to breach by your end customers. At least as long as you have ensured
    that the end customer has accepted the applicable cloud supplier's
    customer agreement. This way of reselling is often combined with end
    customer <strong>unique tenants</strong>, belonging to the end customer.

<p>
Often this way of <strong>reselling</strong> does not
    give the end customer a unique tenant, and is often used by <strong>SaaS
    suppliers</strong> offering <strong>multitenant solutions</strong> or similar, but also exists
    as resale models for <strong>IaaS/PaaS</strong>. Some cloud suppliers do not require
    you to enter into a reseller agreement as such in order to resell
    this way, you can merely be a "normal" customer and resell (for
    instance using <strong>Microsoft Hosting exception</strong>).
