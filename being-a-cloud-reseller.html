    <h1>What you need to know about reselling cloud services?</h1>

    <p><strong>Reselling cloud services can be complex. As a reseller you (and your clients) are
            exposed to a range of obligations from Microsoft, AWS or Google, and it can be difficult
            to get an overview of your numerous rights and obligations.</strong></p>

    <h2> The Basics</h2>

    <p>
        To become a reseller, you will need to enter into a reseller/partner/solution provider
        agreement with the cloud service provider. This will authorize you to resell, but these
        agreements have a complex range of obligations and risk allocations. It can therefore
        be difficult to properly understand, assess and mitigate the potential risks for you
        and your clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will need to establish routines to ensure compliance, and there are "rules of engagement"
        to ensure that you resell the cloud services in accordance with the terms and conditions.
        On top of this, the rules of engagement vary between cloud suppliers.
    </p>

    <h2>Main reseller models</h2>


    <table class="td">
        <tr>
            <td class="big-number">1</td>
            <td>You flow down the terms and conditions from the applicable cloud supplier to the end customer,
                and a direct agreement is established between the end customer and the cloud supplier.
                <!-- <td><img src="media/1flow.png" width="550" /> </td> -->
            <td class="tight"><img src="media/foyen_skytjenester_1_compressed.jpg" width="260px" /> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        This has the <strong>advantage</strong> for you that any <strong>breach by
            end customer</strong> of the customer agreement is normally <strong>handled directly</strong>
        between <strong>end customer</strong> and the <strong>cloud supplier</strong>. With the exception that you
        as reseller will always be <strong>obliged to pay</strong> the applicable cloud
        supplier for any end customer cloud services consumption, you will
        <strong>not be liable</strong> towards the applicable cloud supplier for any damages
        due to breach by your end customers - at least as long as you have ensured
        that the end customer has accepted the applicable cloud supplier's
        customer agreement. This way of reselling is often combined with end
        customer <strong>unique tenants</strong>, belonging to the end customer.
    </p>

    <table class="td">
        <tr>
            <td class="big-number">2</td>
            <td>You do not have to flow down end customer agreement terms from the applicable cloud supplier,
                you are free to contract how you want. You are, however, liable towards the cloud supplier for any breach
                of its reseller agreement or customer agreement
                whether the breach is made by you or any end customer.
            </td>
            <td class="tight"><img src="media/foyen_gdpr_2_compressed.jpg" width="260px" /></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Often this way of <strong>reselling</strong> does not
        give the end customer a unique tenant, and is often used by <strong>SaaS
            suppliers</strong> offering <strong>multitenant solutions</strong> or similar, but also exists
        as resale models for <strong>IaaS/PaaS</strong>. Some cloud suppliers do not require
        you to enter into a reseller agreement as such in order to resell
        this way, you can merely be a "normal" customer and resell (for
        instance using <strong>Microsoft Hosting exception</strong>).

                you need to know as a cloud reseller.
                We also offer agreement templates you can use towards your end customers when reselling
                cloud services - both when you resell IaaS/PaaS, or when you build a customer solution (offer
                your
                software as a service, hosted in Azure, AWS or GCP).
                For Norwegian resellers, we also offer templates for how resale should be done when using the
                government
                templates for IT services and deliverables (SSA).
