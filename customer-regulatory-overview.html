<h1 id="regulatory-overview-x">Regulatory overview x</h1>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>As a Customer of cloud services, you should not only review the
    relevant hyperscalers subscription terms and conditions to have control
    over your rights and obligations. Depending on the business sector you
    operate in, there may also be various laws and regulations you need to
    have control over, and that you need to be compliant with when using
    cloud services. This extends beyond GDPR.</p>
<p>We therefore also provide an overview of regulatory requirements
    applicable to the average customer, such as the Accounting act, Archives
    act, data privacy, and to a large extent also sector specific
    legislation, such as European Banking Association guidelines for bank
    and finance, EIOPA for insurance, NVE rules for energy, the Health
    Registry Act for hospitals etc. In addition to such overview, we
    translate what it means that the Cloud T&amp;Cs should state/give you as
    rights as a customer, in order to be compliant.</p>
<p>In addition to the regulatory overview you get, our risk assessment
    tool is configurable for different customer sectors, so if you for
    instance are a bank you can choose that compliance with EBA guidelines
    should be a part of the tool, so you can use that to assess/document
    compliance.</p>
<h2 id="accounting-act">Accounting Act </h2>
<p>According to the Norwegian Accounting Act section 13 second paragraph
    accounting materials must be stored in Norway for five years after the
    end of the accounting year. Some documentation may be deleted after
    three and a half years.</p>
<p>The types of data that need to be stored in Norway are:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>The yearly accounts and other mandatory account reports, yearly
        report and audit report,</li>
    <li>Specifications to accounts and reports mentioned in (1)</li>
    <li>Documentation for the data in the accounts and deleted data,
        documented control trail and the balance,</li>
    <li>Numbered letters from the auditor,</li>
    <li>Agreements regarding the company, except agreements of “lesser
        importance”,</li>
    <li>Correspondence that provides significant additional information to
        data in the accounts,</li>
    <li>Content slips or other similar documentation accompanying goods, or
        sent to the byer in other ways,</li>
    <li>Mandatory price overviews required by laws or regulations.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an exception, the current regulation concerning bookkeeping accept
    digital storage in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and
    Iceland) without having to apply for an exception, provided that the
    following conditions are met;</p>
<ul>
    <li>the accounting records stored abroad must be available in readable
        form in Norway,</li>
    <li>they must be printable during the entire storage period from a
        terminal or similar in Norway.</li>
    <li>Similarly, the control authorities cannot be denied access to the
        accounting records, and the Directorate of Taxes must be informed in
        writing of the storage and certain details, including information
        regarding which parts of the accounting records are being stored abroad,
        including specifications, what kind of information etc.</li>
    <li>The written notice must also include the company name and address
        where the server is located, and information on how the control
        authorities may access the data at any time.</li>
    <li>The storage duration must satisfy the terms in the Norwegian
        Accounting Act, regardless of the local regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a limited possibility to apply for exception for
    storage in other EEA countries, if you are a part of a corporation which
    have an accounting data solution that stores data outside the Nordic
    countries and you as an affiliated is obliged to use such solution. To
    be granted such dispensation from the Directorate of Taxes, it must be a
    problem for the enterprise with a bookkeeping obligation to meet the
    legal requirement to store said records in Norway. In this case, the
    Directorate of Taxes does not consider cost savings gained by foreign
    storage to constitute an independent basis for dispensation. Where
    dispensation has been granted so far, the deciding factor is whether
    storage abroad is part of a common accounting solution within a group
    company or similar amalgamated entities, and that the storage is taking
    place in a group company or similar abroad or under the control of such
    a company. They have also placed emphasis on whether the data is stored
    in a country with which Norway has entered into a tax treaty.
    Furthermore, there is a condition that accounting records stored abroad
    must be available in readable form in Norway, and that they can be
    printed during the entire storage period from a terminal or similar in
    Norway. Similarly, it is a condition that control authorities cannot be
    denied access to the accounting records.</p>
<p>If you need to use a cloud solution that stores accounting data
    outside the Nordics, and you do not qualify for the abovementioned
    exception, he most common mitigation is to make a read-only export of
    this data and store it on some secured (against destruction, loss or
    alteration) server or media in Norway. It needs to be available for
    audits during the whole storage period, in a form that the Tax Authority
    may process.</p>
<p>Dette betyr således at den løpende bokføringen kan godt skje på en
    løsning i utlandet. Men innen en måned etter fastsetting av
    årsregnskapet og senest sju måneder etter regnskapsårets slutt overfører
    regnskapsmaterialet til oppbevaring i Norge. En bør således tilstrebe å
    velge løsninger med eksport eller arkivmulighetene, som muliggjør
    dette.</p>
<p>We do expect that this requirement will be abolished within a few
    years, due to Regulation 2018/1807 on a framework for the free flow of
    non-personal data in the European Union. As a non-EU EEA country, this
    Regulation is not in force yet in Norway, and it is difficult to tell
    exactly when it will come into effect. We are monitoring the
    developments here.</p>
<h2 id="gdpr">GDPR</h2>
<h2 id="archives-act">Archives Act</h2>
<p>The Archives Act system is based on the responsibility for the
    archive creator or the National Archives. The challenges that arise when
    public archival material is to be included in cloud services are not
    only that the material leave the country, but also that it no longer
    stored in a public body.</p>
<p>The Archives Act does not contain any provisions that directly
    regulate the storage of archives in cloud services, and in principle,
    does not impede such a solution.</p>
<p>Main rule. According to the Archives Act section 9 b. it is
    prohibited to take public archives out of Norway. This applies to both
    paper archives and digital archival material. It is assumed that the
    rule also applies to cloud services. This means that cloud services can
    be used for documentation, but the servers must be located in
    Norway.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Archives Act section 2 letter a and letter b,
    the term “archives” should be understood very broadly. This means that
    most of what is produced or received in public institutions is archives
    and therefore covered by the provision in section 9 b.</p>
<p>Exceptions. The archives Act allows for archives to be taken out of
    the country if it is a necessary part of the administrative or legal use
    of the documents.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>It is allowed to take archives out of the country when it is</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong><em>necessary and temporary</em></strong>, for example in
                connection with international meetings or when documents need to be
                presented in a legal proceeding in another country. A case handler is
                therefore allowed to bring necessary case documents on a business trip.
                Therefore, the Archives Act section 9 b probably only applies to
                relatively permanent storage abroad. Based on such an interpretation,
                cloud services that involve temporary storage of information will be
                exempt from the Archives Act section 9 b.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>It is allowed to store copies of digital archives on servers
            abroad, &gt; <strong><em>provided</em></strong> that the main archive is
            stores in Norway.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For both exemptions, it is required that the Director General for the
    National Archives gives special permission to take archives out of the
    country or supplementary provisions in the Archives Act section 12 is
    fulfilled. Further, the service provider must be an operator within the
    EU/EEA.</p>
<p>Digital storage abroad. Cloud services often process and store data
    on servers located abroad. This is considered as taking archives out of
    the country and is in violation of section 9 b of the Archives Act.
    However, this prohibition does not prevent the purchase of cloud
    services where archives are stored in Norway. However, it is assumed
    that one has control and ownership of their own archives. It is
    important that a risk and vulnerability analysis is carried out. The
    Archive Regulations section 4 require that archive work be subject to
    the organization’s internal control. Among other factors, this means
    that one should have an archive plan that shows what the archive
    includes and how it is organized. In connection with this, one can note
    the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>There are several different methodologies for Risk and
            Vulnerability</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Assessments to choose from. There is no definitive answer about which
                one to choose.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Risk and Vulnerability Assessment of archives, privacy and &gt;
            information security should be viewed in conjunction.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In extension of the above, it must be emphasized that archives stored
    abroad are not subject to Norwegian law. When using cloud storage,
    multiple countries’ legislation may apply, and it can be challenging to
    determine the location of the data at all times. Therefore, to ensure
    control over the relevant information, an important issue is to address
    which legislation that is applicable regarding the handling and storage
    of information in the different countries.</p>
<p>Handling of archival material. The use of foreign cloud services for
    office support, communications, and collaboration that processes
    archival material is not in violation with the Archives Act section 9 b
    if the archival material is continuously stored on a server in Norway.
    It is not necessary to seek exemption from the Archives Act for such a
    use. The regulations do not prevent the storage of any copies abroad, as
    long as the complete archive is stored in Norway.</p>
<p>Transferring data between countries. In standard agreements between
    the cloud service provider and the customer, the provider – unless
    otherwise clearly specified – will normally store the information in a
    variety of locations. This is done, among other things, for security
    reasons. Therefore, information will often be transferred between
    different countries, unless the parties have a clear agreement on what
    is permissible.</p>
<p>We do expect that today’s Archives Act will be simplified and adapted
    to technological developments, and the language in the regulations
    should be mase as understandable as possible. The proposal for a new
    Archives Act will most likely be processed in the Norwegian Parliament
    in the spring of 2024, and work on regulations for the new law is
    already underway. The current estimated time for this is January 2025.
    We are monitoring the developments here.</p>
<h2 id="eba">EBA</h2>
<h2 id="eiopa">EIOPA</h2>
<h2 id="dora">DORA</h2>
<h2 id="nve">NVE</h2>
<p>NVE is responsible for coordinating the work on preventive security
    and emergency preparedness in the power supply. NVE administers and
    relies on six laws associated with regulations in various areas for its
    work.</p>
<p>The Energy Act and the Power of Supply Preparedness Regulations are
    particularly important in connection with cloud services. However, there
    are no specific regulations or prohibitions on the use of cloud services
    in power grid operations in neither the Energy Act nor the Power of
    Supply Preparedness Regulations.</p>
<p>What is worth emphasizing is the use of cloud services in
    KBO-entities. According to the Power of Supply Preparedness Regulations
    section 2-1 second paragraph, KBO-entities means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The business that owns or operate facilities, systems, or
            other</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>infrastructure, and which are classified according to this regulation
                under section 5-2 or section 5-7, or</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Other businesses that the emergency preparedness authority has
            &gt; determined to be KBO-entities pursuant to section 3-1 second &gt;
            paragraph.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>There are no specific regulations of cloud services in law or
    regulation, either generally or for KBO-entities. However, the Power of
    Supply Preparedness Regulations limit to some extent the use of cloud
    services by KBO-entities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Geography</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Requirements for system documentation</li>
    <li>Control over system changes</li>
    <li>Access control</li>
    <li>Operation and maintenance</li>
    <li>Supervision</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, it is relevant to emphasize what KBO-entities can use cloud
    services for. This can be divided into two main areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Information</li>
</ul>
<p>Power-sensitive information. Power-sensitive information is defined
    in section 6-2 and refers to specific and detailed information about the
    power supply that could be used to damage facilities, systems, or other
    infrastructure or affect functions that are significant for the power
    supply, including the items in letter (a) to (j) which provide a
    non-exhaustive list of what power sensitive information can be.</p>
<p>According to the Power of Supply Preparedness Regulations the
    KBO-entities have the responsibility for identifying power-sensitive
    information, as well as controlling the overview of location and access.
    This means that the KBO-entities must have control over where
    power-sensitive information is located, as well as control over cloud
    provider and subcontractor’s access.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the customer must ensure that they, when outsourcing
    services, have measures, routines, and systems as described in section
    6-3. If cloud services are to be used and they process sensitive
    information, special considerations apply to ensure that confidentiality
    is maintained. This can also be derived from section 9-3 second
    paragraph of the Energy Act, which required the signing of a
    confidentiality statement.</p>
<p>The service and all its components <strong>should</strong> be
    process, store and transport within EFTA, EU or NATO. Often it is
    possible to demand and obtain approval that all data centers involved
    should be located withing EFTA, EU or NATO. However, if the data center
    is to be located outside of EFTA, EU or NATO, a risk assessment should
    be conducted, including country risk.</p>
<p>As a main rule KBO-entities can use cloud services for personal data,
    however it is subject to certain conditions. However, the use of cloud
    services for personal data may have challenges outside EEA. The exact
    boundary for such data is unclear, and it must therefore be assessed
    concretely in each individual case.</p>
<p>Other information. As a main rule, KBO-entities can use cloud
    services for other information.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Function</li>
</ul>
<p>Operational control systems. As a main rule KBO-entities cannot use
    sky services for Operational control systems, including SCADA. The clear
    starting point is therefore that such use is prohibited. In extension of
    this, adjacent or interacting systems can be problematic in relation to
    the use of cloud services.</p>
<p>When it comes to other systems, such as DMS, ERP, 0365 etc., it is
    generally allowed, unless there are specific restrictions or limitations
    set by the owner of the system or the service provider.</p>
<p>Given the above, as well as the report “Regulering av IKT-sikkerhet"
    (Regulation of ICT-security) prepared by NVE and the Security Guidelines
    for power-sensitive information in cloud services, several factors
    should be taking into consideration when evaluating cloud services:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Ownership of data through clear regulations. Note that the</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>customer’s information should not be used by the provider for their
                own purposes or shared with other parties without the customer’s
                consent. This also applies to metadata about the customer’s
                information.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The customer shall have updated backups of necessary information,
            &gt; software and configurations of the operating control system that
            &gt; are essential for the operation, safety, and recovery of power &gt;
            supply. The backups shall be stored remotely in a secure location &gt;
            that is easily accessible for the company.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Requirements for cloud providers to have certifications. Even
            though</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>cloud providers are often certified according to recognized
                international standards for information security, the customer should
                explicitly ask about this.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The loss of encryption keys can have critical consequences, as
            it</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>will lead to the loss of encrypted information. Therefore, good
                technical solutions are important.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>An exit strategy that outlines how data can be brought back to
            the</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>company's own or another data center if desired. This may be
                necessary if the provider is acquired and the service offering changes.
                Financial and practical issues must be clarified, including transaction
                costs associated with changing suppliers should be included in the
                calculations.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>

        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Requirements for the customer to be notified if unwanted

<h2 id="health-registry-act-patient-records-act-health-personnel-act-the-health-norm">Health
    Registry Act / Patient Records Act / Health Personnel Act (The Health
    Norm)</h2>
<p>The Government, the Norwegian Directorate of eHealth, as well as the
    supervisory authorities agree that cloud services can be used for
    processing personal data, including special categories of personal
    data.</p>
<p>The Health Registry Act, the Patients’ Records Act and the Health
    Personnel Act impose a number of requirements on the processing of
    health information. In the following, a brief overview of relevant
    regulations within the healthcare sector will be provided. These are
    rules that must be taken into consideration when entering into
    agreements on cloud services.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Health Registry Act.</em></strong> The Act applies to
    “all processing of health information for statistics, health analyses,
    research, quality improvement, planning, management, and preparedness in
    the health and care administration and the health and care services” in
    accordance with section 3 first paragraph. The Act also applies to
    information that is confidential under section 21 of the Health
    Personnel Act, as far as they are applicable, but it does not apply to
    the processing of health information regulated by the Health Insurance
    Act or the Patient Records Act.</p>
<p>According to the Health Registry Act section 4 the Act applies to
    data controllers established in Norway. However, when processing health
    information in companies (data controllers) established outside of
    Norway, but within a country in EU or EEA, the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR) apply. Companies outside the EU or EEA must also
    follow the rules of the GDPR if they offer goods and services to EU or
    EEA citizens, or if they track the behavior of EU or EEA citizens within
    the EU or EEA, cf. Article 3.</p>
<p>When it comes to the availability of health information to foreign
    countries, it is relevant to take a closer look at the provisions in the
    Patient Records Act section 19 and the Health Registry Act section
    19a.</p>
<p>Regarding agreements for the establishment of cloud services, the
    government has particularly emphasized the importance of the fact that
    the chosen solution must meet the customer’s requirements for
    information security. The Health Registry Act section 21 requires data
    controllers and data processors to implement technical and
    organizational measures to archive a level of security that is
    appropriate to the risk. The provision is in line with what is stated in
    the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) article 32. It is worth
    noting that the data processor is subject to obligation under these
    provisions. Cloud services are therefore covered by the provision.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements in GDPR Article 32, the provision in
    section 21 specifies that the requirement for information security also
    includes access control, logging, and subsequent control. This is to
    ensure that health information in the systms is always up to date,
    correct, and only accessible to those who need the information. Further,
    section 21 also states that personal identifying characteristics shall
    be stored encrypted in health registers that are authorized under
    section 10 or 11. Encryption is a security measure that must be
    considered in conjunction with the other security measures.</p>
<p>…</p>
<h2 id="the-patient-records-act">The Patient Records Act</h2>
<p>In accordance with section 3 first paragraph, the Act applies to “all
    processing of health information necessary to provide, administer or
    ensure the quality of health care for individuals”. This implies that it
    concerns sensitive information that must be disclosed to the general
    public.</p>
<p>Section 6 sets requirements for a legal basis to make it legal to
    process health information in treatment-oriented health registers. The
    word “treatment-oriented health registers” is defined in section 2
    letter d.</p>
<p><em>Confidentiality, cf. § 15 </em></p>
<p>Like the Health Security Act, the Patient Records Act contains a
    provision regarding information security in section 22. The provision is
    formulated similarly but does not contain the specific rule on
    encryption of personally identifiable characteristics in health
    registers authorized under section 10 or 11.</p>
