    When subscribing to a cloud service, the terms and conditions normally consist of a large set of complex legal documents, from general terms and conditions, service specific terms, service level commitment, Data Protection Agreement, support terms etc. Just the sheer size of the documents, makes it difficult to understand your rights and obligations.

    Since it is difficult to understand your rights and obligations, its even more difficult to assess whether use of the cloud service and your rights under the cloud subscription terms, ensure that you will be compliant with law and regulations such as GDPR, accounting act, archive legislation, security act etc, or sector specific legislations such as for finance or insurance companies.
