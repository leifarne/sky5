    How complex are the contracts? The agreement structure and large set of contractual obligations makes it difficult to assess if your use of cloud services will be compliant with the subscription terms. 

    You will need to ensure compliance with laws and regulations such as GDPR, Accounting Act, Archive Act, Security Act (to mention a few), and often sector-specific legislation in your industry.

    On top of this, both the contracts and regulations are continuously updated. There is a lot to keep track of, and we are here to help.

    Cloudtermsguide® is built and run by legal experts. The platform gives you an interactive overview of your cloud contracts, lists your rights and obligations, and suggests tailor-made policies to mitigate risk and ensure compliance.
