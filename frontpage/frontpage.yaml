    When subscribing to a cloud service, the terms and conditions normally consist of a large set of complex legal documents from general terms and conditions, service specific terms, service level commitment, data processing agreement, license metrics etc. Just the sheer size of the documents, makes it difficult to understand your rights and obligations.

    The complexity in the agreement structure and the large set of contractual obligations make it even more difficult to assess whether your use of cloud services will be compliant with the subscription terms. In addition, you need to ensure that your use of cloud services is compliant with laws and regulations such as GDPR, Accounting Act, Archive Act, Security Act etc, or sector specific legislation such as for example for finance or insurance companies.

    On top of this, the cloud subscription terms (and possibly also laws and regulations) are continuously updated. This means there is a lot to keep track of, and this is were we can help. 

    Cloudtermsguide® provides tools to help you understand your cloud contracts, understanding your rights and obligations, understanding whether you are compliant, and suggesting policies and steps you can take to mitigate risk and/or ensure compliance.
