    Guide?</h1>
<p><img src="../media/CTG.png" width="650" /></p>
<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
<p>The Cloud Terms Guide will monitor and manage the risks and exposure
    to the cloud contracts and terms from the cloud providers like Amazon,
    Microsoft and Google. It can keep track of current mitigating actions
    and resulting risk profile for you.</p>
<p>The contractual terms will be updated from time to time by the cloud
    providers. The risk items with corresponding recommended mitigations
    will be maintained by specialists from Føyen. The service will alert you
    when a risk has changed as a consequence of the providers’ update of
    their contractual terms. This can lead to your risk action becoming
    invalid, or that the risk exposure has changed. You react to the alert
    and reassess the risk, mitigation and exposure.</p>

<h1 id="benefits">Benefits</h1>
<p>You can maximize business benefits of the cloud while maintaining
    compliance and transparency. New technology is released first on the
    cloud, and later on traditional platforms. Don’t miss out on the
    opportunities (AI, analytics, infrastructure, security) that new
    technology offers. Maximize your usage, avoid the pitfalls and stay in
    control.</p>

        <p>Risk &amp; Compliance for regulated companies and organizations.
            (Do we have control? What is our exposure?).</p>

        <p>Is the mitigation proportional to the risk? Should the mitigation
            be addressed through the contract, finances, organization, process, or
            solution. What is the estimated cost to implement the
            mitigation?</p>

    <li>
        <p>Follow-up of risks and mitigations at the management level. (Have
            you done it?)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Financial write-up when the risk is no longer valid. (When does
            the risk expire? How much?)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The service will help you apply a Cloud First strategy. Segment the
    solutions and go to the Cloud where possible. You can implement
    mitigations that are proportional to the risk while maintaining control.
    Fall back to on-prem when no adequate mitigations are possible.</p>
<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>For each mitigating action you should assess Expected Loss because of
    the residual risk remaining after the mitigation has been implemented.
    That means the annual statistical expected value for cost incurred
    <em>when</em> (not <em>if</em>) that particular risk occurs. If the
    residual risk remaining is greater than Low, there should be an
    estimated for the expected loss.
</p>
<p>The mitigation could be addressed in five principally different ways
    - in the contract, financials, organization, process or solution. If the
    mitigation is addressed through the solution, the action must be
    propagated into a <em>solution requirement</em>, and be handled
    correspondingly. If the mitigation is financial, a <em>cost element</em>
    must be reflected in a budget. If the mitigation is organizational or
    processual, it must be defined as a responsibility for an
    <em>organizational role</em> or defined in an <em>operational process
        description</em>.

<p>Why not just use a spreadsheet or my existing risk management
    tool?</p>
<p>The risks in the Cloud Terms Guide are maintained by legal experts
    from Føyen. They regularly monitor changes to the terms from the cloud
    providers and update the online database, so that cloud risk management
    becomes part of a digital process for the enterprise. The Cloud Terms
    Guide works as Contract-as-a-Service.The CTG is a tool that is simple to
    use for management purposes. Specific risks and mitigations can be
    handled downstream operationally in the organization using a classic
    risk management tool.</p>
