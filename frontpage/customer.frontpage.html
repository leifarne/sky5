<h2>The service gives you:</h2>

<div class="greenBox">
    <h4>1st level </h4> 
    <p> A high level summary of your rights and obligations according to the subscription
         terms from Google, Microsoft and Amazon.
         For many customers this may be a sufficient level.</p>
</div>

<div class="greenBox">
    <h4> 2nd level </h4>
    <p> A detailed review of the subscription terms, so you as a customer gets guidance to 
         turn every rock and really understand the details of your rights and obligations.
         The review also a risk evaluation tool you can use to score the various risks and responsibilities 
         and include possible mitigations. Where sensible, we have included suggestions for mitigations from 
         a legal or solution architect perspective. This can be used to make a thorough decision before contracting.
         For your country it also includes guide to local legislations (applicable for any sector). </p>
</div>

<div class="greenBox">
    <h4>3rd level</h4>  
    <p> A detailed review of the service terms, mapped with any sector specific rules and legislation. 
         If you for instance are a financial institution and subject to European Banking Association regulations,
         or an insurance company subject to EIPOAS regulations, we give you a detailed overview of all applicable rules
         and regulations, and point at how/where they are solved in the applicable T&C’s, and also a recommendation as
         to if you will be compliant or not. As for our 2nd level offering, this includes our risk evaluation tool, 
         and the risk assessment can be stored either in our service or locally by you.</p>
</div>

<p>As there are many different ways to purchase cloud services (either directly from the cloud supplier or via 
    resellers or embedded as part of other services offerings such as SaaS), we give for each of the three cloud 
    suppliers a detailed review of the various programs under which may subscribe. Take Microsoft Azure as an example,
    if you contract directly with Microsoft you may subscribe under the MOSA program if you sign up online, under 
    MCA (Microsoft Customer Agreement), if you sign an agreement with Microsoft or a reseller (CSP), or under 
    the Enterprise Agreement if you have more than 500 subscription licenses (and are a public entity). 
    The terms and conditions differ somewhat from each other, and also differ from Microsoft terms and conditions
    when purchased through a reseller/integrator. We give you guidance irrespective of the agreement model.</p>

    <h3>Why will this be helpful for you?</h3>

    <p>This guide is made by two experienced (20 years +) IT lawyers in Norway + an experienced (28 years + in Accenture) 
        solution architect. They have guided clients both on the customer side and the supplier side and have worked on 
        many of the largest IT and cloud deals in the Nordics in the last decades. By signing up for the service you get 
        access to advices for a low subscription fee, which you as an individual client would have paid several millions for.</p>
    
    <p>Note also that we will also publish updates when relevant. For most of the three cloud suppliers, we see updates in the 
        service terms each month. We offer news alerts and monitoring, so you know when updates have been made, and so that 
        you may do an updated risk analysis. You will by subscribing know if changes in T&Cs make you non-compliant etc. 
        We will also offer additional webinars from time to time.</p>

    <p>Note that the intention of this guide is not to identify terms and conditions that you should try to negotiate with 
        the applicable cloud supplier. Most companies do not have the “negotiation power” to require improvements, so it’s 
        normally a waste of time to try, unless one can point to regulatory requirements applicable to all or segments of customers. 
        As mentioned before, our intention is to enlighten the customers so you all know your rights and obligations, may make 
        enlightened decisions and save “time to market”.</p>

    <h3>Who are our users?</h3>

    <p>Our target group is anyone in an organization that assesses the risk and responsibility in cloud terms, such as 
        legal/compliance, risk assessment, financials, solutioning etc.</p>
