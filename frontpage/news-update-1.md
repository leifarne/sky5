# Microsoft Partner Network Agreement is changed

## Microsoft has created a new “Microsoft Cloud Partner Program” – here is what you need to know. 

On October 3, 2022, the new Microsoft Cloud Partner Program agreement went into effect. Microsoft have stated that the reason behind the new agreement is the transition of business operations to the cloud, and to increase partner growth and success. The agreement replaces the Partner Network Agreement. 

**Here are the relevant changes that you need to be aware of as a Microsoft partner.** 

- In the agreement itself, the main change is that the name has changed from “Partner Network Agreement” to “Cloud Partner Program Agreement”. No changes have been made to the wording or content from the Partner Network Agreement.
- The Additional Terms and the Terms and Conditions Governing Advisors have similarly changed names to “Additional Terms for MCPP Programs” and “Cloud Partner Program Terms and Conditions Governing Advisors”. Otherwise, no changes to the agreement and terms themselves have been made.

However, Microsoft have made some **_key changes to the way the partner program works:_** 
- Partners will now be given the option to qualify for six solution areas that are aligned to the Microsoft Cloud, called “Solutions Partner designations”. 

According to Microsoft, the Solutions Partner designations will make it
          _easier for partners to demonstrate their organization’s expertise and success in a certain solution area, and for 
          customers to identify the organization that have the capabilities they need._ 
 
The solutions areas are as follows:

- 	Data & AI (Azure)
- Infrastructure (Azure)
- Digital & App Innovation (Azure)
- Business Applications 
- 	Modern Work
- Security

# Becoming a Solution Partner 

Partners can attain Solutions Partner designations through receiving a sufficiently high “partner capability score”, a points system which will evaluate a partner based on three main categories called performance, skilling and customer success. 
There are two qualifying levels:
## 1) Solutions Partner level
   - In order to reach the Solutions Partner level, a partner needs to score 70 out of 100 possible points in the solution area.
   - The annual fee to attain a Solutions Partner designation is currently $4,730, though local fees may vary. The Solutions Partner designation replaces the system of gold and silver competencies. 

## 2) Specialization and Expert level 

The new system of designations is available to all type of partners; however, Microsoft has signaled that the designations will be most applicable for **partners providing services.**
