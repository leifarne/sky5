<h2 id="the-service-gives-you">The service gives you: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Level 1</strong> is a summary of your rights and
            obligations according to the subscription terms from Google Microsoft og
            Amazon. For many customers this may be sufficient.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Level 2</strong> is a detailed review of the subscription
            terms, so you as a customer receive guidance to turn every stone and
            really understand the details of your rights and obligations. Our
            service also includes a risk evaluation tool that you can use to score
            the various risks and responsibilities, including possible mitigations.
            Where sensible, we have included suggestions for mitigations from a
            legal and a solution architect perspective. This can be used to make a
            thorough decision before contracting. For your country, it also includes
            guide to local legislation (applicable for any sector).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Level 3</strong> is a detailed review of the service
            terms, mapped with any sector specific rules and legislation. If you for
            instance are a financial institution and subject to European Banking
            Association regulations, or an insurance company subject to EIPOA
            regulations, we provide a detailed overview of all applicable rules and
            regulations. Further we identify how/where such rules and regulations
            are addressed in the applicable T&amp;C’s, and also give an assessment
            as to if you will be compliant or not. As with our Level 2 offering,
            this includes our risk evaluation tool, and the risk assessment can be
            stored either in our service or locally by you.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>As there are many different ways to purchase cloud services (directly
    via the cloud suppliers, via resellers, or embedded as part of other
    services offerings such as SaaS), we provide a detailed review of the
    various subscription programs for each of the three cloud suppliers.
    Take Microsoft Azure as an example, if you contract directly with
    Microsoft you may subscribe under the MOSA program if you sign up
    online, under MCA (Microsoft Customer Agreement) if you sign an
    agreement with Microsoft or a reseller (CSP), or under the Enterprise
    Agreement if you have more than 500 subscription licenses (and are a
    public entity). The terms and conditions differ somewhat from each
    other, and also differ from Microsoft terms and conditions when
    purchased through a reseller/integrator. We give you guidance
    irrespective of the agreement model.</p>
<h2 id="why-will-this-be-helpful-for-you">Why will this be helpful for
    you?</h2>
<p>This guide is made by two experienced (20+ years) IT lawyers and an
    experienced (28+ years in Accenture) solution architect. They have
    guided clients both on the customer and supplier sides, working on many
    of the largest IT and cloud deals in the Nordics over the last decades.
    By signing up for the service, you get access to advice for a low
    subscription fee, which you as an individual client would have paid
    substantially more for.</p>
<p>Note also that we will also publish <strong>updates</strong> when
    relevant. For most of the three cloud suppliers, we see updates in the
    service terms each month. We offer news alerts and monitoring when
    updates have been made, and so that you may do an updated risk analysis.
    By subscribing you will know if changes in T&amp;Cs make you
    non-compliant etc. We will also offer additional webinars from time to
    time.</p>
<p>Note that the intention of this guide is <u>not</u> to identify terms
    and conditions that you should try to negotiate with the applicable
    cloud supplier. Most companies do not have the “negotiation power” to
    require improvements, so it’s normally a waste of time to try, unless
    one can point to regulatory requirements applicable to all or segments
    of customers. As mentioned before, our intention is to enlighten
    customers so you all know your rights and obligations, may make
    enlightened decisions and expidite “time to market”.  </p>
<h2 id="who-are-our-users">Who are our users?</h2>
<p>Our users are anyone in an organization that assesses the risk and
    responsibility of cloud terms, such as legal/compliance, risk
    assessment, financials, solutioning etc.</p>
