<h1>On the Reseller side</h1>

<h3>If you are a reseller of cloud services; do you:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>understand the rights and obligations you get when signing up to be a reseller? </li>
    <li>understand the various reseller models, how it may affect your risk, how it may affect the rights your customers get
         and how it may effect whether your customers will be compliant with regulatory requirements? </li>
    <l1>desire to standardize you end-customer agreements?    </l1>
    <l1>know that you often are liable towards the cloud provider for any end-customer breach of the cloud providers 
        subscription terms, that such liability often is uncapped, and that the obligation to pay damages applies 
        irrespectively of you getting payment from the individual end-customer for the same?</l1>
    <l1>know that you need to mirror more than just the cloud suppliers subscription terms towards the end-customers, 
        as the reseller agreements contain additional obligations you need to mirror?</l1>
</ul>

<p>We tell you what you need to know, so you have control over that and more.</p>

<p>When you are a reseller of cloud services from Microsoft, Amazon or Google, you have either:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>1) Entered into a reseller agreement with the cloud vendor, enabling you to resell the cloud services according to a 
        long list of “resale conditions”. We explain: </dt>
    <dd>Which risks and obligations this entails in general (for instance that the trigger for termination is not always 
        “material breach” with a reasonable time limit to cure, and this combined with termination with immediately effect, 
        may cause risk of business continuity for you and your end-customers).</dd>
    <dd> - Obligations where you should establish routines to ensure compliance</dd>
    <dd> - How you should mirror all your obligations when contracting with end customers</dd>
    <dd> - What you need to include in our agreement with your distributor, if you choose an indirect reseller model</dd>
    <dd> - How the various resale models affect you and your end customers. For instance Amazon End User Account model vs 
        Solution Provider Account model triggers very different ways of reselling + the end customer agreement terms should 
        be substantially different due to your resale rights. And did you know that under some resale models, you as a reseller
         will be held liable by the cloud supplier for end customer breach. Another example, under some resale models end customers 
         will get protection from the relevant cloud supplier (for instance against third party claims), while in other it gets no 
         protection beyond what you as a reseller may offer.</dd>
    <dt>2) You are a end-customer of a cloud supplier yourself, and utilize possibilities in the service terms to utilize the platform 
        to provide value added services to end-customers. For instance, your are a software supplier, offering the software as a 
        service hosted via AWS or Google. Depending on which cloud suppler you choose, and under which program you subscribe under,
         there are many differences you should be aware of, that affects you and the end-customers risk, and how you should phrase
          you own subscription terms towards the end-customers.</dt>
</dl>

<p>For both 1 and 2 you also get access to the “Customer” side of this guide, so you may easily provide your end customer information
     about risk and obligations that the individual end customer must accept when purchasing cloud services.</p>

<p>You will also get access to tools, such as agreement templates for resale of cloud services with different version 
    adapted to fit for the different resale models</p>
