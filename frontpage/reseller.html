<h1>On the Reseller side</h1>

<div class="box">

    <h2>If you are a reseller of cloud services; do you:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>understand the rights and obligations you get when signing up to be a reseller? </li>
        <li>understand the various reseller models, how it may affect your risk, how it may affect the rights your customers get
            and how it may effect whether your customers will be compliant with regulatory requirements? </li>
            <l1>desire to standardize you end-customer agreements?    </l1>
            <l1>know that you often are liable towards the cloud provider for any end-customer breach of the cloud providers 
                subscription terms, that such liability often is uncapped, and that the obligation to pay damages applies 
                irrespectively of you getting payment from the individual end-customer for the same?</l1>
                <l1>know that you need to mirror more than just the cloud supplier's subscription terms towards the end-customers, 
                    as the reseller agreements contain additional obligations you need to mirror?</l1>
                </ul>

<h2>When you are a reseller of cloud services from Microsoft, Amazon or Google, you have either:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Entered into a reseller agreement with the cloud vendor, enabling you to resell the cloud services according to a 
        long list of “resale conditions”. We explain: </li>
        <ul>
    <li>Which risks and obligations this entails in general (for instance that the trigger for termination is not always 
        “material breach” with a reasonable time limit to cure, and this combined with termination with immediately effect, 
        may cause risk of business continuity for you and your end-customers).</li>
    <li>Obligations where you should establish routines to ensure compliance compliance with obligations. This is
        especially important since the threshold for termination is not always “material breach”, nor do
        the reseller always have a cure period before termination for cause may be declared by the
        hyperscaler.</li>
    <li>How you should mirror all your obligations when contracting with end customers, so there is no
        gap between your obligations under the reseller agreements and how you contract with your end
        customers.</li>
    <li>What you as a minimum need to include in our agreement with your distributor, if you choose an indirect reseller model</li>
    <li>How the various resale models affect you and your end customers. For instance some resale
        models require that a binding agreement is entered into between the end customer and the
        relevant hyperscaler when you reseller, while others does not. Amazon End User Account model
        vs Solution Provider Account model This triggers very different ways of reselling + the end
        customer agreement terms should be substantially different due to your resale rights. And did
        you know that under some resale models, you as a reseller will be held liable by the cloud supplier
        for end customer breach?. Another example, under some resale models end customers will get
        protection from the relevant cloud supplier (for instance against third party claims), while in other
        it gets no protection beyond what you as a reseller may offer.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our service includes functionality that allocates responsibility internally to dedicated resources
        when it comes to follow up of the various risks and responsibilities. The tool also facilitates
        notification to your administrator when people do not follow up tasks. And if the reseller
        agreements change, we will notify you of important updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>You are a end-customer of a cloud supplier yourself, and utilize possibilities in the service terms
        to utilize the platform to provide value added services to end-customers. For instance, your are a
        software supplier, offering the software as a service hosted via AWS or Google. Depending on
        which cloud suppler you choose, and under which program you subscribe under, there are many
        differences you should be aware of, that affects you and the end-customers risk, affects liability
        (yes you may become liable towards the hyperscaler for breach made by your end customers)and
        how you should phrase you own subscription terms towards the end-customers.</li>
</ol>

<p>For both 1 and 2 you also get access to the “Customer” side of this guide, so you may easily provide your end customer information
     about risk and obligations that the individual end customer must accept when purchasing cloud services.</p>

<p>You will also get access to tools, such as agreement templates for resale of cloud services with different version 
    adapted to fit for the different resale models</p>

<p><strong>We have spent the time needed to understand these highly complex reseller agreements in
    order to help resellers understand the “rules of engagement”.</strong></p>
