## Archives Act

The Archives Act system is based on the responsibility for the archive
creator or the National Archives. The challenges that arise when public
archival material is to be included in cloud services are not only that
the material leave the country, but also that it no longer stored in a
public body.

The **Archives Act does not contain any provisions that directly regulate
the storage of archives in cloud services**, and in principle, does not
impede such a solution.

Main rule. According to the Archives Act section 9 b. it is **prohibited
to take public archives out of Norway**. This applies to both paper
archives and digital archival material. It is assumed that the rule also
applies to cloud services. This means that **cloud services can be used
for documentation, but the servers must be located in Norway**.

In accordance with the Archives Act section 2 letter a and letter b, the
term "archives" should be understood very broadly. This means that most
of what is produced or received in public institutions is archives and
therefore covered by the provision in section 9 b.

Exceptions. The archives Act allows for archives to be taken out of the
country if it is a necessary part of the administrative or legal use of
the documents.

- It is allowed to take archives out of the country when it is

   necessary and temporary, for example in connection with
  international meetings or when documents need to be presented in a
  legal proceeding in another country. A case handler is therefore
  allowed to bring necessary case documents on a business trip.
  Therefore, the Archives Act section 9 b probably only applies to
  relatively permanent storage abroad. Based on such an
  interpretation, cloud services that involve temporary storage of
  information will be exempt from the Archives Act section 9 b.

- It is allowed to store copies of digital archives on servers abroad,
    provided that the main archive is stores in Norway.

For both exemptions, it is required that the Director General for the
National Archives gives **special permission** to take archives out of the
country or supplementary provisions in the Archives Act section 12 is
fulfilled. Further, the service provider must be an **operator within the
EU/EEA.**

### Digital storage abroad.
Cloud services often process and store data on servers located abroad. This is considered as taking archives out of thecountry and is in violation of section 9 b of the Archives Act. However,
this prohibition does **not prevent the purchase of cloud services where
archives are stored in Norway.** However, it is assumed that one has
control and ownership of their own archives. It is important that a **risk
and vulnerability analysis is carried out.** 

    The Archive Regulations section 4 require that archive work be subject to the organization's
     internal control. Among other factors, this means that one should have an archive plan 
     that shows what the archive includes and how it is organized. 
     
 ### In connection with this, one can note the following:

- There are several different methodologies for Risk and Vulnerability Assessments to choose from. There is no definitive answer about which one to choose.

- Risk and Vulnerability Assessment of archives, privacy and information security should be viewed in conjunction.

- In extension of the above, it must be emphasized that archives stored
abroad are not subject to Norwegian law. When using cloud storage,
multiple countries' legislation may apply, and it can be challenging to
determine the location of the data at all times. Therefore, to ensure
control over the relevant information, an important issue is to address
which legislation that is applicable regarding the handling and storage
of information in the different countries.

### Handling of archival material 
The use of foreign cloud services for
office support, communications, and collaboration that processes
archival material is not in violation with the Archives Act section 9 b
if the archival material is continuously stored on a server in Norway.
It is not necessary to seek exemption from the Archives Act for such a
use. The regulations do not prevent the storage of any copies abroad, as
long as the complete archive is stored in Norway.

### Transferring data between countries 
In standard agreements between the cloud service provider and the customer, the provider -- unless
otherwise clearly specified -- will normally store the information in a
variety of locations. This is done, among other things, for security
reasons. Therefore, information will often be transferred between
different countries, unless the parties have a clear agreement on what
is permissible.

We do expect that today's Archives Act will be simplified and adapted to
technological developments, and the language in the regulations should
be mase as understandable as possible. The proposal for a new Archives
Act will most likely be processed in the Norwegian Parliament in the
spring of 2024, and work on regulations for the new law is already
underway. The current estimated time for this is January 2025. We are
monitoring the developments here.
