Registry Act / Patient Records Act / Health Personnel Act (The Health
Norm)</h2>
<p>The Government, the Norwegian Directorate of eHealth, as well as the
supervisory authorities agree that cloud services can be used for
processing personal data, including <strong>special categories of
personal data.</strong></p>
<p>The Health Registry Act, the Patients’ Records Act and the Health
Personnel Act impose a number of requirements on the processing of
health information.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-following-a-brief-overview-of-relevant">In the following,
a brief overview of relevant</h3>
<p>regulations within the healthcare sector will be provided. These are
rules that must be taken into consideration when entering into
agreements on cloud services.</p>
<h2 id="the-health-registry-act">The Health Registry Act</h2>
<p>The Act applies to “all processing of health information for
statistics, health analyses, research, quality improvement, planning,
management, and preparedness in the health and care administration and
the health and care services” in accordance with section 3 first
paragraph.</p>
<p>The Act also applies to information that is <strong>confidential
under section 21 of the Health Personnel Act,</strong> as far asthey are
applicable, but it does not apply to the processing of health
information regulated by the Health Insurance Act or the Patient Records
Act.</p>
<p>According to the Health Registry Act section 4 the Act applies to
data controllers <strong>established in Norway</strong>. However, when
processing health information in companies (data controllers)
established outside of Norway, but within a country in <strong>EU or
EEA</strong>, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) apply.
Companies <strong>outside the EU or EEA</strong> must also follow the
rules of the GDPR if they offer goods and services to EU or EEA
citizens, or if they track the behavior of EU or EEA citizens within the
EU or EEA, cf. Article 3.</p>
<p>When it comes to the availability of health information to foreign
countries, it is relevant to take a closer look at the provisions in the
<strong>Patient Records Act section 19 and the Health Registry Act
section 19a.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding agreements for the establishment of cloud services, the
government has particularly emphasized the importance of the fact that
the chosen solution must meet the customer’s requirements for
<strong>information security</strong>. The Health Registry Act section
21 requires data controllers and data processors to implement technical
and organizational measures to archive a level of security that is
appropriate to the risk. The provision is in line with what is stated in
the General Data Protection Regulation <strong>(GDPR) article
32</strong>. It is worth noting that the data processor is subject to
obligation under these provisions. Cloud services are therefore covered
by the provision.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements in GDPR Article 32, the provision in
section 21 specifies that the requirement for information security also
includes access control, logging, and subsequent control. This is to
ensure that health information in the systms is always up to date,
correct, and only accessible to those who need the information. Further,
section 21 also states that personal identifying characteristics shall
be stored encrypted in health registers that are authorized under
section 10 or 11. Encryption is a security measure that must be
considered in conjunction with the other security measures.</p>
<p>…</p>
<h2 id="the-patient-records-act">The Patient Records Act</h2>
<p>In accordance with section 3 first paragraph, the Act applies to “all
processing of health information necessary to provide, administer or
ensure the quality of health care for individuals”. This implies that it
concerns sensitive information that must be disclosed to the general
public.</p>
<p>Section 6 sets requirements for a legal basis to make it legal to
process health information in treatment-oriented health registers. The
word “treatment-oriented health registers” is defined in section 2
letter d.</p>
<p><em>Confidentiality, cf. § 15 </em></p>
<p>Like the Health Security Act, the Patient Records Act contains a
provision regarding information security in section 22. The provision is
formulated similarly but does not contain the specific rule on
encryption of personally identifiable characteristics in health
registers authorized under section 10 or 11.</p>
