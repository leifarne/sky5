<h1> What is Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)? </h1>

<h3>
The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is a new EU regulation that will apply in the EU from January 2025. The goal of DORA is to enhance the resilience of the financial sector against operational disruptions and cyberattacks, thereby protecting financial stability and ensuring confidence in the financial system.</h3>

<h2> Introduction to DORA</h2>
<p>The DORA aims to ensure that organizations are able to <strong> withstand operational outages from ICT-related incidents,</strong> which would help <strong> preserving the stability and integrity of the Union financial markets</strong> and this contribute to ensuring a high level of protection of investors and consumers in the Union.</p>

<h2>Who is covered by DORA?</h2>
<p> <strong> DORA applies to a broad range of entities in the financial sector including:
</strong></p2>
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Credit institutions:</strong> Banks, savings banks, investment firms, and other institutions that provide credit and investment services.</li>
<li> <strong>Insurance companies:</strong> Life insurance companies, non-life insurance companies, and other institutions that provide insurance services.</li> 
  <li><strong> Investment funds:</strong> UCITS, hedge funds, and other institutions that manage investments.</li>
 <li><strong>Market infrastructure actors:</strong> Stock exchanges, clearinghouses, and other institutions that operate financial market infrastructure.</li> 
  <li><strong>ICT third-party service providers:</strong> Providers of ICT services to the above entities.</li>
</ul>

<h2> What are the key provisions of DORA?</h2>
<strong> DORA imposes a number of requirements on financial entities, including:</strong>
<ul> 
        
<li><strong>Risk-based approach to ICT management:</strong>DORA distinguishes between ICT services supporting critical or important functions and those that are not considered critical or important. The regulation repeatedly makes use of this distinction, and stricter requirements are generally imposed on ICT services supporting critical or important functions.</li>
        
  <li> <strong>Risk management: </strong>Entities must regularly identify, analyze, and assess risks to their ICT systems and operational processes. They must also have a plan to manage these risks. The regulation also imposes several requirements on managing risks associated with third-party ICT providers.</li>
        
  <li><strong>Contractual requirements:</strong>Contracts between financial entities and ICT third-party service providers must include a minimum set of specific clauses, and the requirements are expanded if the vendor supports critical or important functions.</li>
        
  <li><strong>Security and testing:</strong>Entities must implement robust security measures to protect ICT systems and data from cyberattacks. This includes measures such as access control, encryption, logging, and monitorng. They must also regularly test the security of their ICT systems. </li>
        
  <li><strong>Incident management:</strong>Entities must have a plan to handle IT incidents and disruptions to ensure that they do not have a significant impact on financial stability.</li>
        
  <li> <strong>Reporting:</strong> Entities must report IT risks and incidents to the relevant supervisory authorities.</li>
        
</ul>

<h2>How to Utilize and Benefit from Our DORA Tool </h2>

<h3>Gaining an overview of the financial regulatory landscape and its obligations can be time-consuming and resource intensive.</h3>

<p> Our Mapping tool is designed to assist organizations in effectively complying with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), as well as EBA and EUIPO.</p>

<p>We have categorized the regulation into 15 categories. These categories include, but are not limited to, <strong> "Governance Principles”, "Notification to FSA”, "Documentation Requirements”, and "Risk Assessment”.</strong></p>

<blockquote> Each category is organized with a series of subcategories where we summarize the key regulatory requirements. In addition, we have put work and analysis into compiling the most important information across regulations as “Føyens assessments”, which is our value add compared to a regular mapping tool.   </blockquote>

<H2>The tool can be used to:</H2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conduct risk assessments directly within the tool.</strong> This means that users can perform risk assessments without having to use separate software or processes.</li>
        
  <li><strong>Gain an overview of what has been done and what needs to be done.</strong> The tool provides a centralized view of all risk assessments, allowing users to track progress and identify areas that need attention.</li>
        
  <li><strong> Delegate responsibility.</strong> Users can assign tasks to different team members, ensuring that everyone is aware of their responsibilities and deadlines.</li>
        
  <li><strong>Set up commitments in an annual wheel.</strong> The tool can be used to create a visual representation of risk mitigation activities throughout the year, helping to ensure that all risks are addressed in a timely manner.</li>
        
  <li><strong>Extract relevant data.</strong> The tool allows for the export of relevant data, such as during audits.</li>
                                                                                         
</ul>

<blockquote>
Overall, the tool provides a comprehensive solution for managing risk assessments and ensuring that all necessary actions are taken to mitigate potential risks and ensure compliance.</blockquote>
