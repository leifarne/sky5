                <h1>Know your obligations</h1>
                <p>Cloud contracts are complex. Whether you are a customer or reseller, the terms and conditions consist
                    of intricate
                    legal documents, and it can be hard to keep track of your vast responsibilities. </p>
                <p>
                    What can go wrong? Worst case, the provider switches off your access to the cloud.

                <p>
                <p>How complex are the contracts? The agreement structure and large set of contractual obligations makes
                    it difficult to assess if your use of cloud services will be compliant with the subscription terms.
                </p>

                <p>You will need to ensure compliance with laws and regulations such as GDPR, Accounting Act, Archive
                    Act, Security Act (to mention a few), and often sector-specific legislation in your industry.</p>

                <p>On top of this, both the contracts and regulations are continuously updated. There is a lot to keep
                    track of, and we are here to help.</p>

                <p>CloudtermsguideÂ® is built and run by legal experts. The platform gives you an interactive overview of
                    your cloud contracts, lists your rights and obligations, and suggests tailor-made policies to
                    mitigate risk and ensure compliance.</p>
