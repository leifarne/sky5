<h1 id="detailed-walkthrough">Detailed Walkthrough</h1>
<p>The walk through is intended to give customers and potential
customers of Microsoft online services a detailed overview of its rights
and obligations, in order to help customers to understand them when
contracting. Hopefully this will enable potential customers to contract
faster, and existing customers to be able to be compliant with the terms
and conditions. This is not an exhaustive list and you should use this
as a guide when reviewing the terms and conditions yourself.</p>
<p>Note that Microsoft Customer Agreement andOnline Service Terms does
not have numbered clauses. They only use headlines with theme
description, and occasionally «subletter” numbering.</p>
<h2
id="product-terms-universal-license-terms-for-all-online-services">Product
Terms; Universal License Terms for all Online Services</h2>
<p><strong>General remark:</strong> The Product Terms vary a bit for
each individual service, so it is important to review the applicable
parts for the services used by you. There are however universal license
terms that apply for all online services, and we comment the most
important below.</p>
<h2
id="product-terms-general-service-terms-specific-service-terms-other">Product
Terms; general service terms, specific service terms, other</h2>
<p><strong>General remark:</strong> In addition to the universal license
terms, which are commented above, the product terms for each online
service vary a bit from service to service. In addition to universal
license terms for online services, there may also be additional license
terms for software. For each service, for instance “Microsoft Azure User
Plans, Microsoft Azure Services etc there are general regulations (such
as availability, subscription term, purchase rules, payment options
available and reservation rules), there are often general service terms,
and specific service terms that you need to review. Below we mention
only a few important regulations, which not necessarily apply to all
online services. It’s however important that you review the product
terms applicable for your service, as there are many rules as to how you
can use the individual service/what triggers payment of extra licenses
etc.</p>
<p>You only find the Product Terms online, see
https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/welcome/welcomepage. Note that
in order to find the applicable version of the Product Terms for the
services you subscribe to, you also have to select the correct program
you subscribe under (EA, MCA, MOSA etc) in the licensing page, as they
may vary from program to program.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-sla">Microsoft SLA</h2>
<p><strong>General remark:</strong> In order to understand which SLAs
that apply for the Online services you subscribe to, you normally have
to check: 1) the Online Services SLA document, which has SLAs for D365,
O365 and other online services such as Power BI, Power Apps, etc 2) and
Microsofts SLA for Azure and Azure plan, which are found online here:
http://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/</p>
<p>In general, each SLA has a very clear definition of Uptime, how
Downtime is calculated for each service (and this varies from service to
service; some count minutes, other counts hours etc), agreed Uptime
percentage and what service credits will be.</p>
<p>Note that SLAs normally are given for the individual service, not
necessarily the combined “solution” you buy to support your business
needs. This means that if you buy several services which has similar
uptime, for instance 99,9, this will not be the actual availability
offered by Microsoft as the actual uptime will be the multiplication of
the individual online service uptime percentage, which normally will be
lower.</p>
<p>Be also aware of that as the SLAs are individual per service, so will
the service credits be. Are your “solution” down, the service credit
refund will be given for the individual service failing, and the price
reduction in percentage will be based on the lowest price level
available in Microsoft’s pricing. For instance, if a VM is causing
downtime for your “solution”, only the price for the WM is relevant for
service credit calculation, and if you buy 20 VM’s, and one fails with
the consequence that your entire “solution” is down, only the price for
that specific VM is relevant when calculating service credit.</p>
<p>Its therefor important to review the general terms and conditions in
the SLA document, and the individual service SLAs when you design your
“solution”. In the following we comment the general terms and conditions
in the SLA document, and a couple of individual SLAs.</p>
<h2
id="microsoft-products-and-services-data-protection-addendum">Microsoft
Products and Services Data Protection Addendum</h2>
<p>Last updated September 15, 2021</p>
<p><strong>General remark:</strong> Microsofts DPA is, in our view,
acceptable from a customer perspective and in line with what we consider
«market practice» for (cloud)suppliers. It may however be perceived as
complex due to Microsofts license-based contract structure, but after
reviewing we think its consistent and also reasonable balanced from a
customer perspective.</p>
<p>Some regulations are however worth noting, see the assessment below.
For instance that the DPA can be updated frequently, regulations related
to storage time for data, routines for notification of safety breaches,
notification of change of subcontractors, limited possibility for
claiming damages from Microsoft if you as a Customer is held jointly
liable towards data subjects for damages caused by Microsoft, and
regulations related to transfer of personal data to locations outside
EU.</p>
<p>Be especially aware of the regulations related to transfer of
personal data outside EEA. In the latest update of the DPA, Microsoft’s
terms and conditions address in Appendix C specifically the problems
that arose after Schrems II, and introduces some additional safeguards.
Microsoft confirms also that EEA Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC)
v.2021 is used to facilitate the transfer. However, the standard DPA
from Microsoft does in fact not address the real problem with Schrems
II, i.e. that the conclusion of court was that the law in for example
USA does not sufficiently protect the personal data from access by the
authorities. It is therefore still essential that you as a customer
carry out a (country specific) risk assessment in accordance with the
guidelines from EDPB and Data inspectorate. This assessment must be
carried out before you start using the online services, as Microsoft’s
terms and conditions clearly states that Microsoft will use
subcontractors and/or personnel located outside of EEA.</p>
