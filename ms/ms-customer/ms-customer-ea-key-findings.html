<h1>Detailed walk through of Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA),
        including Product Terms, SLA, and Data Protection Addendum</h1>
<p>When you subscribe to, or purchase perpetual, software licenses or
        subscribe to Online-services directly from Microsoft through an
        Enterprise Agreement, the Enterprise Agreement with annexes normally
        consist of the following documents:</p>

<p><img src="media/ea-terms.png" /></p>

<p>For Online-services the following documents also apply (not reviewed):</p>

<p><img src="media/ea-online-services.png" /></p>

<p>It also incorporates additional terms, that applies under any program:</p>

<p><img src="media/ea-additional-terms.png" /></p>

<p>For some sectors, additional terms and conditions may apply, such as
        for bank and finance. There may also be eligibility requirements in
        order to subscribe to certain services for sectors, such as education or
        public sector.</p>

<blockquote>
        <p>Note that it is also possible to contract software products and
                Online-services through other contract types, for instance under the MCA
                program or MOSA for Online services. See more about Microsoft’s
                different programs here.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
        <p>Note also that subscription of online services under the Enterprise
                Agreement is no longer possible for private entities but must be done
                under MCA or other Microsoft programs. Public customers may however
                still subscribe to online services under the Enterprise Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>We highlight the following key findings in the Microsoft
                Enterprise Agreement (incl. Product Terms, SLA and DPA) seen from a
                customer perspective:</strong></p>
<h2><img class="icon" src="media/ring.png" />Qualification requirements:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
                To qualify for an enterprise agreement, you need to order at
                least 500 Licenses in a single Product pool for Enterprise Products,
                covering Qualified Users / Qualified Devices.
        </li>
</ul>
<h2><img class="icon" src="media/vekst.png" />Commercial:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
                Fees: Prices and payment terms are determined by Microsoft Sales
                Affiliate, set out in the Customer Price Sheet. Payment for software is
                normally linked to list prices and the applicable customer price level
                you qualify to (based on the volume of your total commitment). Price
                levels vary from A-D.
        </li>
        <li>
                Prices will be fixed through the applicable initial or renewal
                enrollment, <u>provided</u> customer qualifies for the same price level
                for the entire term.
        </li>
        <li>
                Microsoft can at its sole discretion change the price level for
                future new orders.
        </li>
        <li>
                Customer may choose to pay upfront or spread the payment in three
                equal installments. Invoices will be adjusted based on true-up/true
                down, and payment for the reserved licenses may be postponed until the
                next true-up order and shall be invoiced retroactively to the month in
                which the reserved licenses were ordered. Invoices will be adjusted to
                reflect any reduction in Subscription Licenses. Mid-term orders for
                products must be paid upfront, and online services may be paid annually
                or upfront.
        </li>
        <li>
                All prices are exclusive of taxes. Normally this will be added by
                the Microsoft Sales Affiliate that invoice you. Should be checked before
                agreement is entered into.
        </li>
        <li>
                Audit; Microsoft has a right to verify compliance with license
                metrics, subject to a 30 days prior written notice. If the verification
                reveals excessive use above 5%, then customer must pay the cost of the
                audit and pay for such additional licenses at 125% of the then current
                list price /applicable customer price level. If an audit has been
                conducted, and customer was sufficiently licensed, Microsoft will not
                conduct a new audit the coming year.
        </li>
</ul>
<h2><img class="icon" src="media/avtale.png" />License specifics, general:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
                Customers obtain a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use software
                products, in the quantity ordered.
        </li>
        <li>
                The use right for subscription licenses applies for the
                subscription term.
        </li>
        <li>
                You need separate licenses for users vs devices. E.g., all
                licenses need to be assigned to a device or user as appropriate, but may
                be reassigned. Reassignment cannot happen more often than 90 days,
                unless because of hardware failure, if employees quit, or temporary
                reallocation of CAL’s, Client Management Licenses or SLs to cover a
                user’s absence or unavailability of a device.
        </li>
        <li>
                Licenses must be activated with a product key.
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>You may make as many copies as needed to distribute them within
                        your Enterprise. You may also use:</strong>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                up to 20 copies of licenses products in a dedicated training
                                facility,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                use up to 10 copies of products for a 60-day evaluation
                                period
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                and use one copy of all products to back-up or archival purposes
                                in each of your locations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                There is also a limited re-imaging right
                        </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong> You may not: </strong>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                Use the products to offer commercial hosting services to third
                                parties or work around technical limitations
                        </li>

                                without Microsoft’s approval
                        </li>

                                separate and run parts of a Product or Fix on more than one
                                device, upgrade or downgrade parts of a Product or Fix at different
                                times, or transfer parts of a Product or Fix separately. Multiplexing
                                does not reduce the number of Licenses needed.
                        </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
                Subscription licenses (and software assurance) are temporary and
                expire normally when the applicable enrollment expires/terminates. For
                some products, customer may have a buyout option. Note that software
                assurance often give you use rights to additional functionality (vital
                to you), and if SA is not renewed for a product where you have perpetual
                use rights, you still cannot use such additional functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
                The use rights/restrictions per product, are described in Product
                Terms, which are important to review, in order to have control over that
                your intended use is covered by the licenses granted, or whether you
                risk procuring additional licenses.
        </li>
        <li>
                Product Term updates apply for you, for versioned software, but
                materially changes after you entered into your contract (enrollment),
                will not apply during the enrollment term unless you choose to use a new
                version. That updated use restrictions may be introduced through the
                agreement term, poses a risk, as this may change included use/what needs
                to be paid extra for. E.g the TCO become uncertain, and if you have
                negotiation strength, you should consider negotiating this to the
                better. If you however license Enterprise Products, updated Product
                Terms for a version, does not apply during the initial term or renewal
                term.
        </li>
        <li>
                You must order and maintain continuous Software Assurance for
                each License ordered. E.g you cannot terminate Software Assurance until
                the enrollment expire, and you enter into a new one. If terminated, you
                will need to buy new licenses to get SA again.
        </li>
</ul>
<h2><img class="icon" src="media/avtale.png"/>License specifics, orders, true-up, step-up etc:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
                Product not previously ordered can be used first when an order is
                submitted.
        </li>
        <li>
                For products already licensed, additional licenses can be used at
                any time but must be included in the next true-up order.
        </li>
        <li>
                The true-up, gives you flexibility to increase your use of
                already licensed products (e.g more user or device licenses etc) without
                ordering such from Microsoft before the end of each agreement
                year.
        </li>
        <li>
                The deadline to send such update statement is 30 days before the
                end of the agreement year, at the earliest 60 days before.
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                For “Enterprise Products”, the order shall list the number of
                                qualified devices or users when the true up-order <u>is placed</u>.
                                E.g., you do not have to pay for additional licenses you have had
                                through the year, that are removed again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                For “Additional Products”, you pay for the <u>highest number
                                        used</u> since the initial order (or the last true-up or anniversary
                                date, if not ordered the same year).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                For online services you can for some services also use the
                                true-up, but you have to place a reservation order.
                        </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
                If you forget, you must wait a year (with the audit risk this
                entails as the prices will be 125%).
        </li>
        <li>
                The is a limited right to true-down for subscription licenses if
                your use through additional orders or true-up orders is above the
                initial quantity. (Step-up licenses or add-on Subscription Licenses are
                not relevant in the count).
        </li>
        <li>
                Some licenses may be upgraded to higher editions (Step-up). This
                is ordered as for other software products (true-up is allowed if
                included in the initial order, if not a new order must be placed
                etc)
        </li>
</ul>
<h2><img class="icon" src="media/avtale.png"/>License specifics, assignment, acquisitions, divestures etc:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
                Fully paid perpetual licenses may be transferred to your
                affiliates or third parties in connection with transfer of hardware or
                employees as part of a divesture, merger or similar. Such transfer must
                be notified to Microsoft according to the contract wording, but not
                necessarily according to case law.
        </li>
        <li>
                You cannot transfer Software Assurance, unless licenses are
                reassigned within your enterprise.
        </li>
        <li>
                In an affiliated company ceases to be owned 50%, Microsoft must
                be notified, and continued use presuppose that Microsoft accepts. There
                is no grace period/transitional period.
        </li>
        <li>
                If you acquire another company, sell parts of your company or
                merge with a third party, and your number of licenses change with more
                than 10%, then Microsoft will work with you in good faith to accommodate
                the changed circumstances.
        </li>
</ul>
<h2><img class="icon" src="media/ring.png"/>Business continuity:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
                Subscription period/termination notice: The MBSA and the EA
                Agreement has no set duration and may be terminated by either party for
                convenience with 60 days written notice. The EA Purchase Agreement and
                EA Enrollment, however, has a 36-month duration, with an option to renew
                for additional 36 months. Note however that Microsoft may reject renewal
                (will not unreasonably reject). If the MBSA and EA Agreement is
                terminated, this does not affect existing orders/enrollments, but new
                ones cannot be entered into.
        </li>
        <li>
                Some Online services may continue beyond 36 (+ 36) months, unless
                explicitly cancelled minimum 30 days prior to the expiration date
                (Extended Term). The prices will however be +3% administrative fee, so
                such a situation should be avoided, as its possible to get better
                prices.
        </li>
        <li>
                Suspension: The is a suspension right for Microsoft in the
                Acceptable Use Policy regulation in Product Terms, where the threshold
                for suspension is only “to the extent reasonably necessary”. Customer
                will receive notice in reasonable time before suspension happens, unless
                Microsoft «believes an immediately suspension is required”. E.g.,
                Microsoft may suspend all Online services and not only the affected
                service, can lock out all users and not only the user breaching the
                policy, and customer is not guaranteed a notification in advance/a right
                to cure before suspension happens. In addition, Microsoft may suspend
                the services if customer is in material breach (for instance if you are
                under-licensed) and will only give notice «when reasonable». For
                business-critical solutions, where you subscribe this poses a risk from
                a customer perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
                Infringement: In case Customer receives a third-party claim
                alleging that the use of the Online services infringes such third party
                IPR, Microsoft may choose between modifying or replacing the services or
                <u>terminate the service with immediate effect</u>. There is no
                obligation for Microsoft to for instance use «all reasonable efforts» to
                resolve or replace the affected service, before Microsoft may choose to
                terminate and refund any prepaid fees. The termination right is absolute
                and do not consider the consequences for the customer, e.g., is it
                possible to establish an alternative service fast for the
                customer?
        </li>
        <li>
                Immediate termination right: In case of material breach, which is
                not cured within 30 days after notice, either party may terminate with
                <u>immediate effect</u>. E.g., if Microsoft terminate the customer
                cannot expect or require the online service, or continue to use
                subscription software, for a «transitional» period, until the customer
                has successfully established alternative services. For business-critical
                solutions, this poses a risk from a customer perspective.

                Termination right, Material breach of one Enrollment which
                “affects” other Enrollments, also give Microsoft a right to terminate

                Change to or removal of online services: Microsoft may according
                to the product terms <u>remove or replace online services at any
                        time,</u> however removal or replacement of material features or
                functionality normally presuppose 12 months’ notice except that an
                expedited removal is allowed if required due to security, legal or
                system performance considerations. E.g. this may from time to time make
                it difficult to plan for the changes for the customer, and in a
                worst-case scenario it may affect customers operations. For the services
                you buy, you should therefore investigate their update frequency and
                when such updates become mandatory/cannot be postponed anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
                Changes to or removal of functionality in software products, is
                not addressed. E.g. Microsoft may freely do this in new versions. You
                should investigate how long you can continue to use existing
                versions/when sunset of support happens.
        </li>
        <li>
                For online- services, SLAs are normally given (and compensated)
                for the individual service, not necessarily the combined “solution” you
                buy to support your business needs. This means that if you buy several
                services which has similar uptime, for instance 99,9, this will not be
                the actual availability offered by Microsoft as the actual uptime will
                be the multiplication of each of the individual online service uptime
                percentages, which normally will be lower.

<h2><img class="icon" src="media/vekt.png"/>Legal:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
                Limited warranty: Microsoft disclaims all liability for loss due
                to errors/downtime in software/Online services, which is fairly normal
                in the “average” license agreement. Customers only sanction for online
                services is «Service Credits» (a percentage of the monthly amounts paid,
                given as a credit), provided Microsoft accept the customer claim for
                credits. For software a 12-month limited warranty promise that the
                software will perform substantially as described in the documentation,
                if not Microsoft as a sole remedy may either repair or return the
                license fees. E.g. customer has limited rights to withhold payment or
                claim damages due to errors/downtime, terminate for cause etc. E.g there
                is no traditional maintenance/SLA commitment from Microsoft as to how
                quick critical errors in software are corrected.
        </li>
        <li>
                Liability general: Both parties’ liability is limited to an
                amount equaling the amounts paid during the 12 months prior to the
                incident.
        </li>
        <li>
                Customer liability, carve outs from the normal liability cap: If
                customer breaches confidentiality (for instance tells a third party of
                the contents of its agreement with Microsoft and which is not publicly
                known), violates Microsoft IPR (such as being under-licensed) or
                Microsoft faces a third party claim due to customer data (including
                customer owned or licensed applications) or breaches the IPR of such
                third party, no limitations of liability apply.
        </li>
        <li>
                Customer liability for affiliates or third parties: As a customer
                you are allowed to let your affiliates use the Online-services, external
                users (temps, consultants, suppliers etc), and you may also build
                offerings (such as SaaS) to your own customers and use Online-services
                as part of your offering. For all situations, you are liable for such
                party’s compliance with the Microsoft terms and conditions, and for
                compensating Microsoft for any loss in this respect. E.g you should
                inform your affiliates and external users/customers of important
                obligations in the terms and conditions (most importantly the acceptable
                use policy, license restrictions and export control rules), and you
                should consider asking them for an indemnification if they do not comply
                with the regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
                Separate terms: Separate terms may apply for third party services
                made available as part of the Online services. Always verify if such
                exist or not, and review if applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
                Updated terms and conditions: The MBSA etc will not change during
                a subscription, before you accept the changes, however you may be
                required to do so for Microsoft to accept new orders/renewal of the
                subscription term. The terms and conditions links to additional terms,
                such as Product Terms, SLA and DPA. These terms are often updated, often
                once a month, and may change to the worse from a customer perspective,
                but material adverse changes for a particular version will not apply
                during the applicable license, subscription, or billing period.
        </li>
        <li>
                Order of precedence: (1) DPA, (2) MBSA, (3) Enterprise Agreement
                (4) Enrollments; (5) Product Terms; (6) DPA and SLA; and (7) any other
                documents in the agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
                Jurisdiction: The terms and conditions are subject to Irish law,
                even though you reside in another jurisdiction. If you contract directly
                will Microsoft, you will also enter into an agreement with the local
                Microsoft entity for billing etc, where the venue will be local
                Microsoft entities country as venue. This may make it difficult to
                initiate a legal process against Microsoft, where aspect related to the
                performance of the cloud services/products and third-party claims will
                be subject to Irish law, while claims related to payment/license metrics
                and similar will be subject to local law.

<h2><img class="icon" src="media/sikkerhet.png"/>DPA/Privacy</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
                Microsoft’s DPA is from an overall “customer perspective”
                acceptable, and in line with what you should expect from a cloud
                supplier. It’s fairly balanced seen from a customer perspective.
                However, see below with regard to the regulation related to transfer of
                personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
                After an update in November 2020, Microsoft undertake to
                indemnify data subjects for any material/non-material damage. This is
                actually just the same as what follows from GDPR. However, if you are
                sued yourself by a data subject, and are held to be jointly liable for
                damages also caused by Microsoft, your ability to claim restitution for
                damages from Microsoft, is limited by the general limitation of
                liability (a sum equaling 12 months service fees).
        </li>
        <li>
                Be especially aware of the regulations related to transfer of
                personal data outside EEA. Microsoft confirms in its DPA that EEA
                Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) v.2021 is used to facilitate the
                transfer. Furthermore, the DPA includes an Appendix C specifying some
                additional safeguards and an attachment 1 including specific GDPR terms.
                However, none of these documents implements additional measures as
                required according to the Schrems II-decision. The customer, as the
                controller, has to carry through a risk assessment in accordance with
                art. 32 of the GDPR to verify the extent to which a third party
                (including the authorities) may get access to the personal data in
                transit, as well as in rest and when the personal data is processed. You
                must in this assessment also take into consideration to which extent
                data is transferred to third countries without sufficient protection of
                personal data in the relation to the authorities’ access to the personal
                data. Even if you conclude that the personal data is not transferred or
                that the personal data is under all circumstances sufficiently protected
                against such access from third party, you must be aware that you,
                according to art. 28.1 in the GDPR, can only enter into agreements with
                processors that is providing sufficient guarantees to implement
                appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that
                processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the
                protection of the rights of the data subjects.” The issue regarding
                access to the personal data from the authorities may have been
                sufficiently solved contractually in the DPA because Microsoft states
                the following in the DPA: “Microsoft will only disclose or provide
                access to any Processed Data as required by law provided that the laws
                and practices respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms
                and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic
                society and, as applicable, to safeguard one of the objectives listed in
                Article 23(1) of GDPR”. However, the European Data Protection Board
                (EDPB) has in its guidelines stated that a controller also has to verify
                that the processor is capable of meeting such an obligation. This may be
                difficult, especially with regards to USA if the problematic legislation
                regarding the authorities access in an assessment is deemed to have
                extraterritorial effect. It is therefore still essential that you as a
                customer carry out the (country specific) risk assessment in accordance
                with the guidelines from EDPB and Data inspectorate. This assessment
                must be carried out before you start using the online services.
        </li>
        <li>
                As the other terms and conditions under the MCA, the DPA may be
                updated frequently. Look therefore for updates, in good time before your
                subscription renews, so you can carry out an updated risk assessment
                if/when the terms and conditions are changed.
        </li>
        <li>
                Note that your customer data is deleted 90 days after
                expiry/termination.
        </li>
</ul>
<h2>End remark</h2>
<p>As you see, there are many regulations which differ in balance from a
        traditional sourcing agreement, and the customer protection is weaker.
        The agreement balance is more in line with a traditional license
        agreement. The product is standardised (which it must be), you get what
        you get, and there are limited possibilities to claim damages etc.</p>
<p>Even though there are many “unfavourable” terms and conditions from a
        customer perspective, we do not see many examples that this affects the
        customers in daily life. An “average company”, will not face any
        problems as long as you pay in time. But if Microsoft does not like your
        attitude when using their services, it’s easy for Microsoft to kick you
        out. Since the service are standardised, it’s to expect that the terms
        and conditions also are standardised and consider that Microsoft
        customers are a diverse, spread over many different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Our clear recommendation is that the balance in the terms and
        conditions, should not stop you from going to the cloud. But, since the
        risk and responsibilities are as is, you should make a careful and
        thorough assessment of the impacts it may have and how you may mitigate
        the risks before taking the decision. For several business sectors there
        are specific rules and regulations that needs to be fulfilled, and then
        you need to map the terms and conditions with such rules. The financial
        sector is an example here. Our recommendation is that all customers do a
        similar exercise when contracting Online Services or software products
        that will have a critical or important impact on your business if they
        fail.</p>

<blockquote>
        <p>Note that there is limited possibility to negotiate “better” terms
                with Microsoft. You should not focus your time on trying that, but
                rather do a proper risk assessment. Our experience is that it is close
                to impossible to negotiate with Microsoft unless you are subject to
                general or sector specific rules and regulations where the Microsoft
                terms and conditions will not make you compliant, or <u>unless</u> you
                do a large commitment for use of Online-services. If you desire to
                negotiate, it is also important to subscribe to the online services
                under the Enterprise program, as this is the only program that offers
                the possibility to negotiate with Microsoft.</p>
</blockquote>
<strong>
        <p>Note also that you should establish routines to ensure compliance
                with, as a minimum, the following:</p>
</strong>
<ul>
        <li>
                A true-up order must be sent within 60-30 days before the
                anniversary of the agreement
        </li>
        <li>
                If your use does not exceed the previous year, remember to send
                an update statement. If not, you increase the risk for an
                audit.
        </li>
        <li>
                Since Microsoft may unreasonably object to renewal after the
                initial 36 months term, you show get Microsoft to confirm in due time,
                if prolongment is desirable. Prolongment for online-services is probably
                not a good idea, as the prices increase for the 36 months
                prolongment.
        </li>
        <li>
                If you intend to negotiate a new agreement instead of prolonging
                the existing up to 6 years, start such negotiation process early,
                minimum 12 months before expiry. If not it will be even more difficult
                to end up with a good negotiation result.
        </li>
        <li>
                Remember to actively terminate online services that are eligible
                for an Extended Term, or enter into a new agreement. Just to continue is
                expensive!
        </li>
        <li>
                Remember to inform Microsoft of countries in which Affiliates use
                products.
        </li>
