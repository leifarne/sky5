<h1 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When you contract Microsoft Online-services <strong>directly from
Microsoft (called MCA Enterprise)</strong> or through a <strong>reseller
(called MCA Indirect)</strong> you always need to <strong>accept
Microsoft terms and conditions.</strong></p>
<h3
id="in-both-situations-a-binding-agreement-is-then-entered-into-between-you-and-microsoft.-the-term-and-conditions-normally-consist-of-the-following-documents">In
both situations, a binding agreement is then entered into between you
and Microsoft. The term and conditions normally consist of the following
documents:</h3>
<p><img src="media/MCA.png" width="550"/></p>
<p>For some <strong>sectors</strong>, additional terms and conditions
may apply, such as for bank and finance. There may also be eligibility
requirements in order to subscribe to certain services for some sectors,
such as education or public sector.</p>
<p>In addition to the terms and conditions mentioned above, you either
have to enter into an enrollment (order form) if you contract the MCA
through Microsoft, or an agreement with your CSP if you contract the MCA
through a reseller.</p>
<pre><code>        Note that it is also possible to contract Microsoft Online-services through other contract types, 
        for instance subscribing directly at www.azure.com and accept Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA), 
        or to become an enterprise customer and enter into an Enterprise agreement with Microsoft. 
        See more about Microsoft’s different programs here.</code></pre>
<p>Compared to a traditional sourcing agreement, we <strong>highlight
the following key findings</strong> in the Microsoft Customer Agreement
(incl. Product Terms, SLA and DPA) seen from a customer perspective.</p>

Business continuity</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Subscription period/termination notice: Normally you can choose
between an ongoing subscription where you are billed monthly, or you can
commit to a fixed term subscription. If you have not committed to a
fixed term, Microsoft may cancel your subscription with 60 days’ notice,
irrespective of how long it may take you to establish an alternate
solution (for instance to implement a new hosting platform). A fixed
term subscription will normally be from 12 months up to 3 years. During
a fixed term, Microsoft cannot terminate your subscription for
convenience until the subscription term expires. Committing to a fixed
term subscription may give you better prices, and it will give you more
predictability as to minimum duration. Note that if you buy through a
reseller, a fixed term subscription agreed with the reseller will not be
binding for Microsoft, unless approved by Microsoft.</p></li>
<li><p>Suspension: Microsoft has a wide right to suspend the online
services in case of breach. The regulation is fairly balanced, as it
links the right to suspension to “material breach”, and that customer
fails to cure after a 30 days’ notice period. The exception is that 1)
an immediate suspension is required to safeguard customer data or the
Online services in general, 2) in case of violation of trade laws, 3) or
in case payment is declined. As for 2) and 3) ideally, there should also
be a notification, and dialogue process to either avoid suspension or to
resolve it.</p></li>
<li><p>Suspension of “Acceptable Use Policy». The is a separate
suspension regulation under the AUP regulation in Product Terms, where
the threshold for suspension is «only to the extent reasonably
necessary”. Customer will receive notice in reasonable time before
suspension happens, unless Microsoft «believes an immediately suspension
is required”. E.g., Microsoft may suspend all Online services and not
only the affected service, can lock out all users and not only the user
breaching the policy, and customer is not guaranteed a notification in
advance/a right to cure before suspension happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Infringement: In case Customer receives a third-party claim
alleging that the use of the Online services infringe such third party
IPR, Microsoft may choose between modifying or replacing the services or
terminate the service with immediate effect. There is no obligation for
Microsoft to for instance use «all reasonable efforts» to resolve or
replace the affected service, before Microsoft may choose to terminate
and refund any prepaid fees. The termination right is absolute and do
not consider the consequences for the customer, e.g., is it possible to
establish an alternative service fast for the customer?</p></li>
<li><p>Immediate termination right: In case of material breach, which is
not cured within 30 days after notice, either party may terminate with
immediate effect. E.g., if Microsoft terminate the customer cannot
expect or require the service for a «transitional» period, until the
customer has successfully established alternative services. For
business-critical solutions, this poses a risk from a customer
perspective.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="solutioning"><img src="media/hjelp.png" style="color:#A33F1F" width="50"/>
Solutioning</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Change to or removal of online services: Microsoft may according
to the product terms remove or replace online services at any time,
however removal or replacement of material features or functionality
normally presuppose 12 months’ notice except that an expedited removal
is allowed if required due to security, legal or system performance
considerations. In the latter this may from time to time make it
difficult to plan for the changes for the customer, and in a worst-case
scenario it may affect customers operations. There is no obligation for
Microsoft to use commercially reasonable efforts to change the service,
rather than removing services in mentioned situations. This should be
assessed further for business critical solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>SLAs are normally given (and compensated) for the individual
service, not necessarily the combined “solution” you buy to support your
business needs. This means that if you buy several services which has
similar uptime, for instance 99,9, this will not be the actual
availability offered by Microsoft as the actual uptime will be the
multiplication of each of the individual online service uptime
percentages, which normally will be lower.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="commercial"><img src="media/vekst.png" style="color:#A33F1F" width="50"/>
Commercial</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Fees: Depending on whether you contract the MCA directly with
Microsoft (MSA Enterprise) or through a reseller (CSP Indirect), you
either need to agree the service fees directly with Microsoft (through
an order form) or with your reseller (CSP) (through a resale/purchase or
similar agreement such as SSA-D, SSA-V, SSA-L, SSA-Sky).</p></li>
<li><p>Fees, invoicing: It’s important to understand that the use of the
Online services can be scaled up as you need, and that no use limits are
set. You pay for the consumption you have made, as this is measured by
Microsoft. It’s your own risk if the consumption increases above what
you expect, however you may set limits to avoid such situations. Note
that if you buy through a reseller (CSP), your resale/purchase agreement
with the reseller will probably introduce a 25-day deadline to object to
any invoices (as this is the corresponding deadline that applies for the
CSP through its agreement with Microsoft (Microsoft Partner Agreement).
After the deadline has expired, you will have to pay whatever the
Microsoft meter shows (even if you believe the consumption is wrong or
if you believe that the consumption is higher than necessary due to
errors in the Online services). Any objections set forth within the
deadline will be processed by Microsoft, but until Microsoft has
processed your complaint, you need to pay the amount due without any
right to withhold/offset. If you contract the MSA directly with
Microsoft, you should check the enrolment whether similar regulations
apply.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="legal"><img src="media/vekt.png" style="color:#A33F1F" width="50"/>
Legal</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Limited warranty: Microsoft disclaims all liability for loss due
to errors/downtime, which is fairly normal in the “average” cloud
agreement. Customers only sanction is «Service Credits» (a percentage of
the monthly amounts paid, given as a credit), provided Microsoft accept
the customer claim for credits. E.g. customer has limited rights to
withhold payment or claim damages due to errors/downtime, terminate for
cause etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Liability general: Both parties’ liability is limited to an
amount equaling the amounts paid during the 12 months prior to the
incident.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer liability, carve outs from the normal liability cap: If
customer breaches confidentiality (for instance shares the details of
its agreement with Microsoft with a third party which is not publicly
known), violates Microsoft IPR or Microsoft faces a third party claim
due to customer data (including customer owned or licensed applications)
or breach of such third party IPR, no limitations of liability apply.
This means that there is no liability cap for the most typical customer
breach situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer liability for affiliates or third parties: As a customer
you are allowed to let your affiliates use the Online-services, external
users (temps, consultants, suppliers etc), and you may also build
offerings (such as SaaS) to your own customers and use Online-services
as part of your offering. For all situations, you are liable for such
party’s compliance with the Microsoft terms and conditions, and for
compensating Microsoft for any loss in this respect. E.g you should
inform your affiliates and external users/customers of important
obligations in the terms and conditions (most importantly the acceptable
use policy, license restrictions and export control rules), and you
should consider asking them for an indemnification if they do not comply
with the regulations.</p></li>
<li><p>Separate terms: Separate terms may apply for third party services
made available as part of the Online services. Always verify if such
exist or not, and review if applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated terms and conditions: The Microsoft Customer Agreement
will not change during a subscription, before you accept the changes,
however you may be required to do so for Microsoft to accept new
orders/renewal of the subscription term. The terms and conditions links
to additional terms, such as Product Terms, SLA and DPA. These terms are
often updated, often once a month, and may change to the worse from a
customer perspective, but material adverse changes for a particular
version will not apply during the applicable license, subscription, or
billing period.</p></li>
<li><p>Order of precedence: (1) DPA; (2) MCA; (3) Product Terms; (4)
SLA; and (5) any additional terms presented when an order is
placed.</p></li>
<li><p>Jurisdiction: The terms and conditions are subject to Irish law,
even though you reside in another jurisdiction. If you contract directly
will Microsoft, you will also enter into an agreement with the local
Microsoft entity for billing etc, where the venue will be local
Microsoft entities country as venue. This may make it difficult to
initiate a legal process against Microsoft, where aspect related to the
cloud services will be subject to Irish law, while claims related to
payment/license metrics will be subject to local law. If you buy through
a CSP, you will probably have your jurisdiction as venue in such
contract as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="dpaprivacy"><img src="media/sikkerhet.png" style="color:#A33F1F" width="50"/>
DPA/Privacy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Microsoft’s DPA is from an overall “customer perspective”
acceptable, and in line with what you should expect from a cloud
supplier. It’s fairly balanced seen from a customer perspective.
However, see below with regards to the regulation related to transfer of
personal data.</p></li>
<li><p>After an update in November 2020, Microsoft undertake to
indemnify data subjects for any material/non-material damage. This is
actually just the same as what follows from GDPR. However, if you are
sued yourself by a data subject, and are held to be jointly liable for
damages also caused by Microsoft, your ability to claim restitution for
damages from Microsoft, is limited by the general limitation of
liability (a sum equaling 12 months service fees).</p></li>
<li><p>Be especially aware of the regulations related to transfer of
personal data outside EEA. Microsoft confirms in its DPA that EEA
Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) v.2021 is used to facilitate the
transfer. Furthermore, the DPA includes an Appendix C specifying some
additional safeguards and an attachment 1 including specific GDPR terms.
However, none of these documents implements additional measures as
required according to the Schrems II-decision. The customer, as the
controller, has to carry out a risk assessment in accordance with art.
32 of the GDPR to verify the extent to which a third party (including
the authorities) may get access to the personal data in transit, as well
as in rest and when the personal data is processed, see more comments to
the DPA below.</p></li>
<li><p>As the other terms and conditions under the MCA, the DPA may be
updated frequently. Look therefore for updates, in good time before your
subscription renews, so you can carry out an updated risk assessment
if/when the terms and conditions are changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that your customer data is deleted 90 days after
expiry/termination.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="end-remark">End remark</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>As you see, there are many regulations which differ in balance
from a traditional sourcing agreement, and the customer protection is
weaker. The agreement balance is more in line with a traditional license
agreement. The product is standardised (which it must be), you get what
you get, and there are limited possibilities to claim damages
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though there are many “unfavourable” terms and conditions
from a customer perspective, we do not see many examples that this
affects the customers in daily life. An “average company”, will not face
any problems as long as you pay in time. But if Microsoft does not like
your attitude when using their services, it’s easy for Microsoft to kick
you out. Since the service are standardised, it’s to expect that the
terms and conditions also are standardised and consider that Microsoft
customers are a diverse, spread over many different
jurisdictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Our clear recommendation is that the balance in the terms and
conditions, should not stop you from going to the cloud. But, since the
risk and responsibilities are as is, you should make a careful and
thorough assessment of the impacts it may have and how you may mitigate
the risks before taking the decision. For several business sectors there
are specific rules and regulations that needs to be fulfilled, and then
you need to map the terms and conditions with such rules. The financial
sector is an example here. Our recommendation is that all customers do a
similar exercise when contracting Online Services that will have a
critical or important impact on your business if they fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that there is limited possibility to negotiate “better”
terms with Microsoft. You should not focus your time on trying that, but
rather do a proper risk assessment. Our experience is that it is close
to impossible to negotiate with Microsoft unless you are subject to
general or sector specific rules and regulations where the Microsoft
terms and conditions will not make you compliant, or unless you do a
large commitment for use of Online-services. If you desire to negotiate,
it is also important to subscribe to the online services under the
Enterprise program, as this is the only program that offers the
possibility to negotiate with Microsoft.</p></li>
