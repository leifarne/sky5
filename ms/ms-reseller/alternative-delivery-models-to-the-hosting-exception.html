<h1>Alternative delivery models to the hosting exception</h1>

<p>In order to avoid the mentioned <em><strong>hosting exception
                        risks</strong></em>, there is always the possibility to become a
        Microsoft reseller (and enter into a Microsoft Partner Agreement).</p>

<h2>Hosting exception vs. Microsoft Partner Agreement</h2>

<ul>
        <li>
                <p>In such situation, when you resell Azure services to your end
                        customers, the mentioned risks disappear, as the individual end-customer
                        and Microsoft will enter into a direct agreement between the parties,
                        including DPA.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
                <p>If end-customer is in breach it will only affect such
                        end-customer. You as a reseller are not liable for such breach towards
                        Microsoft.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
                <p>We assume that the reason why so many SaaS providers in the
                        market are using the "hosting exception" instead of becoming a CSP, is
                        that under the "hosting exception" the Azure tenant will belong to the
                        SaaS provider, and the end-customers will not have one tenant each. Then
                        it is easier to establish a multitenant solution, keeping cost down when
                        mass distributing updates to all end customers at once etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
                <p>When being a CSP, you will need to establish at least one tenant
                        per end-customer (single tenant), and this may add cost in your
                        offering.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
                <p>A benefit however, is that you may also sell other Azure services
                        to the end-customer, than what you need for your own SaaS
                        offering.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
                <p>Microsoft itself obviously consider the Microsoft Partner
                        Agreement as a possible way for SaaS suppliers to sell Azure services to
                        its end customers as part of the SaaS offering.</p>
        </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the guide to the channel authorization under Microsoft
                Partner Agreement it is stated that:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>        &quot;Company (that&#39;s you as a reseller) may provision tenants to be dedicated as the &quot;Azure Partner Shared Services&quot;*
        tenants for the purpose of Company&#39;s provisioning shared resources and to host multi-tenant SaaS solutions using Azure&quot;. </code></pre>
<p><strong>It is also stated that:</strong></p>
<pre><code>        &quot;Microsoft grants Company the right to access and use Azure Partner Shared Services for the 
        above purposes and to purchase Azure services for internal consumption&quot;.</code></pre>
<p>As a SaaS provider, you may therefore use the Azure Partner Shared
        Services to host multi-tenant SaaS solutions, and you may (as a
        reseller) also purchase the Azure serviced you need. But such Azure
        consumption will be subject to the terms in Microsoft Customer
        Agreement.</p>
<p>E.g you are bound by the T&amp;Cs as a normal Customer, and it is
        important that you adhere to such terms and conditions, such as the
        <strong><em>Acceptable Use Policy, License restrictions, Export control
                        regulations, and any use limitations in the Product Terms
                        etc.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>You should assess carefully if other obligations are relevant to
        adhere to as well, depending on which Azure services you use.</p>
<h2>Cloud Solution Provider and Microsoft Partner Portal</h2>
<ul>
        <li>An advantage for SaaS providers when becoming a CSP rather than
                being a Customer, is also that you get access to Microsoft Partner
                Portal and all the information therein.</li>
        <li>You are also included in Microsoft's partner incentives program, for
                instance you will get kick-back through the Partner Earned Credits
                incentive.</li>
        <li>On the other side, you may as a Saas provider choosing the "hosting
                exception", also be given investment funds from Microsoft, that may be
                used to bouid the SaaS/Azure combined services.</li>
        <li>A "downside" of using the CSP model as SaaS supplier, vs using the
                hosting exception, is that each of your end-customers, also will be a
                customer and owned by Microsoft. Under the hosting exception, Microsoft
                does not know the identity of your end-customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether the one vs the other model is best for you, should be
        investigated further by you, by including Microsoft in the
        assessment.</p>
