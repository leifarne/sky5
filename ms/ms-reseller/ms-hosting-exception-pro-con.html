<h1>Summary, pro et con assessment of the various ways to contract as a SaaS supplier</h1>

<p>The columns “EA”, “MCA” and “MOSA” shows the contractual risk, when you as a SaaS supplier use the “hosting exception” as your
    legal basis for using Azure services as part of your SaaS offering. E.g you are a customer of Microsoft yourself, under either
    the EA, MCA or Mosa program.</p>

<p>The column “you are a CSP” shows the contractual risk, when you as a SaaS supplier also act as a reseller for Microsoft, and
    the end-customer gets its own Microsoft subscription/tenant.</p>

<p>If we write N/A under an area, this means that there is no specific regulation.</p>
