    detailed walktrough</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>When you sign up as a customer of Microsoft by accepting the
        Microsoft Customer Agreement, the general rule in the Microsoft Customer
        Agreement is that you as a customer are allowed to use the Online
        services:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
    “solely for Customer’s own use and business purposes and are
    non-transferable and you are not entitled to distribute, sublicense,
    rent, lease, or lend any Online services, in whole or in part, or use
    them to offer hosting services to a third party”.
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning you are as a general rule not allowed to share the power of
    Microsoft Online-services with third parties. According to the Product
    Terms you are <strong>however as a customer allowed to:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
    “create and maintain a Customer Solution and, despite anything to the
    contrary in Customer’s volume licensing agreement, combine Microsoft
    Azure Services with Customer Data owned or licensed by Customer or a
    third party, to create a Customer Solution using the Microsoft Azure
    Service and the Customer Data together. Customer may permit third
    parties to access and use the Microsoft Azure Services in connection
    with the use of that Customer Solution. Customer is responsible for that
    use and for ensuring that these terms and the terms and conditions of
    Customer’s volume licensing agreement are met by that use”.
</blockquote>
<h3>Customer Solution definition:</h3>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Customer Solution</strong> means any application that the
    Customer makes available to its end users consisting of Customer’s
    applications and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/Glossary/all">Microsoft
        Azure Services</a>, whereby Customer’s application adds primary and
    significant functionality and is not primarily a substitute to the <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/Glossary/all">Microsoft
        Azure Services</a>. Customer applications that only provide billing,
    license management, and/or infrastructure services (e.g., virtual
    machines, containers, storage, or management for such infrastructure
    services) do not constitute “primary and significant functionality.”
</blockquote>
<h3>Customer Data definition:</h3>
<blockquote>
    “<strong>Customer Data</strong> means all data, including all text,
    sound, video, or image files, and software, that are provided to
    Microsoft by, or on behalf of, Customer through use of the Online
    Service. Customer Data does not include Professional Services Data”.
</blockquote>
<p>This means that if you build a <strong>Customer Solution</strong>, e.g. you
    have developed or you are licensed to offer an application as a service
    to end customers, and you use Microsoft Azure Services as your hosting
    platform, , you are allowed to do so, even though you <strong>indirectly share
        the power of Microsoft Online-services with third parties</strong>. But you can
    only do it when your offering to end customers is the application (SaaS)
    as such, and not access to Microsoft Azure services disconnected from
    the SaaS offering (for instance Office 365/allowing end-customer to host
    its own applications etc). The end-customer does not get its own
    subscription in this situation, nor administrative access to the Azure
    tenant.</p>
<p><strong>Note – if you use Azure as your hosting platform for your
        services, but the end-customers does actively store own data in the
        solution, for instance you have a IOT offering that monitors defined
        data such as radon, then you should focus on understanding Microsoft
        Customer Agreement in general, and not these additional considerations
        for SaaS solutions.</strong></p>
<h2 id="benefit-and-possible-risks">Benefits</h2>
<p>When using the hosting exception as your legal basis for “reselling”
    Microsoft Online Services, the most obvious benefit is that you may
    set-up a multitenant offering towards your end-users.</p>
<p>Also you do not have to ensure that your end-customers accept
    Microsoft Customer Agreement and enter into an agreement directly with
    Microsoft (as is required of you as a CSP). We see that a lot of the
    large international SaaS providers are choosing this way when offering
    its own SaaS solutions to end customers.</p>
<p>Not having to mirror Microsoft Customer Agreement towards the end
    users, may seem appealing, as it will save the individual end customer
    the “time and trouble” of having to review the agreement and adhere to
    it (and having a direct contractual relationship with Microsoft). E.g.
    it may seem as a way to simplify the end-customers contract process.</p>

<h2>Possible risks</h2>

<p>However, Microsoft Online Service Terms, and the “hosting exception”
    clearly states that even if you are allowed to “<em>permit third parties
        to access and use the Microsoft Azure Services in connection with the
        use of that Customer Solution”,</em> you as the Customer of Microsoft
    and the SaaS provider to your end customer are however “<em>responsible
        for that use and for ensuring that these terms and the terms and
        conditions of Customer’s volume licensing agreement are met by that
        use”.</em></p>
<p>As the “hosting exception” clearly states that you are obliged to,
    and are responsible for ensuring that your end customers adhere to your
    obligations as a customer in Microsoft Customer Agreement, you
    <u>should</u> flow down the same obligations, restrictions and limited
    warranties, towards your end customers, or you will not be able to
    ensure compliance with your obligations towards Microsoft etc. At least
    you will have the financial risk.
</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-most-important-risks-to-mirror">What are the most
    important risks to mirror: </h2>
<p>The most important regulations in Microsofts T&amp;Cs that should be
    mirrored towards the end customers (and which we assume is the highest
    risk of breaking) are:</p>
<h3>Acceptable use policy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        the <strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong> in Product Terms
        (which have prohibitions against illegal content, using the online
        services for illegal purposed, to spam and distribute malware
        etc),
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Restrictions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        the <strong>Use Restrictions</strong> (don’t reengineer, work
        around technical limitations, impear Microsofts IPR or share the online
        services with third parties etc.).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Export Control regulations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mirror Export Control regulations towards the end customers.,
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

    Relevant parts of Microsoft <strong>Product terms</strong> - as
    the end-customers do not get their own tenant in Azure, with
    administrative privileges, you do not necessarily have to flow down the
    entire Microsoft T&amp;C’s, Product Terms etc, as the end-customer does
    not control which services are used, nor which license metrics that are
    relevant. </p>

<p>You should however always review the applicable Product Terms
    and assess whether:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        specific use limitations for the online-services you plan to use,
        allows you to host your application in Azure and provide this as a SaaS
        to your end-customers the way you have planned
    </li>
    <li>
        specific use limitations should be mirrored towards
        end-customers, for instance as part of your subscription fee model,
        depending on which Online-services you use. For instance, if you as the
        customer pay per core, how should this be reflected in the pricing
        against your end-customers if you have a per user subscription
        fee?
    </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>You should as a minimum also consider to mirror or address:</h2>
<h3>Limited Warranty</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        the <strong>Limited Warranty</strong> Microsoft gives for its
        Online-services, including limitations of liability, so you are not
        liable towards your end-customers for errors, defects, downtime etc in
        the Online-services, which may affect your SaaS services.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Change rights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        the unilateral right for Microsoft to change or sunset its
        online-services from time to time, as this may affect the SaaS service
        towards your end-users
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fee adjustments</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        and possible address towards the end-customers how your SaaS
        subscription fee may change, if you need to make significant changes in
        your set-up because Microsoft changes or sunsets parts of the
        online-services (e.g. leading to significant cost in redesign of your
        set-up).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Indemnification</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Since you, as a customer of Microsoft, will be liable towards
        Microsoft for any breach of Microsoft T&amp;C’s made by your own
        customers, you should also mirror such liability in your end customer
        agreement, for instance write:
        <blockquote class="mitigation">
            “End Customer agrees to indemnify you against any claim from
            Microsoft under the Microsoft Customer Agreement, to the extent such
            claim arises due to end customers failure to adhere to the obligations
            in the Microsoft Customer Agreement which apply for end-customer”.
        </blockquote>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Protection Agreement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        No data processor agreement is established between Microsoft and
        the individual end-customer with Microsoft. You will therefore have to
        treat Microsoft as a sub processor in your own DPA towards the
        end-customers, and to build in appropriate clauses in your own DPA to
        deal with this.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>When you are using Microsoft as such a sub processor, you will as
    processor need to carry out a risk assessment in accordance with article
    32 in the GDPR. The end-customer will, as part of the end-customer’s
    obligations under the GDPR, have to request this risk assessment from
    you and include this assessment in the end-customer's own needed risk
    assessment also in accordance with article 32 in the GDPR.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft often use service technicians and/or provides
    services from outside EEA without adequacy decision, personal data will
    most probably be exported to such counties. You must therefore assess
    whether You or Microsoft is the exporter and the transfer mechanism that
    will be used, respectively by You and/or Microsoft. You have to decide
    whether you need to conduct a TIA (Transfer Impact Assessment) or
    whether it is sufficient that the transfer is evaluated in the risk
    assessment in accordance with article 32. The end-customers will request
    information about such assessments from You as part of the
    end-customer’s own risk assessment in accordance with article 32 in
    GDPR. Therefor you should:</p>
<blockquote class="mitigation">
    You should check whether the Azure services used to offer your SaaS
    offering in fact depend on either transfer of personal data to countries
    outside of EEA and or countries without adequacy decision, including use
    of service technicians outside of this area. If so, you should as a
    minimum inform your end customers so they are aware and so they may make
    their own assessments and request potential documentation from you.
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to be <strong>100% sure that there is no gap</strong> between your
    obligations towards Microsoft and what you mirror against your SaaS end
    customers, you can <strong>mirror the entire Microsoft Customer Agreement (with
    all additional agreement documents which are linked to therein, such as
    the SLA and Product Terms etc)</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="is-the-hosting-exception-an-ideal-model-from-an-end-customer-perspective">Is
    the “Hosting Exception” an ideal model from an end-customer
    perspective?</h2>

<p>The consequence for end-customers, of you being a customer yourself
    with Microsoft and since the individual end-customer does not establish
    its own direct agreement with Microsoft is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        that the end-customer gets no protection from Microsoft in case
        <strong>third party infringement claims</strong>. Only the “Customer” is for instance
        protected under the MS Customer Agreement “against third party claims”,
        not “third parties” if directly sued such as your end
        Customers.
        <blockquote class="mitigation">
            <strong>Mitigations to consider:</strong> You should therefore be
            careful to offer a full indemnity to your end customers for infringement
            claims related to Microsofts Online services, and state that a condition
            for such indemnity is that Microsoft protects you and compensates the
            same towards you.
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>GDPR liability.</strong> As end-customer does not enter into a DPA directly with
        Microsoft, but Microsoft is handled as a sub processor, end-customers
        get no protection under the Microsoft data processing agreement for any
        loss due to breach thereof. Only you as the “Customer” is given the
        opportunity to claim damages in case of breach by Microsoft of the DPA,
        and not the end-customer as the controller.
        <blockquote class="mitigation">
            <strong>Mitigations to consider:</strong> There are none. This
            means that if en-customer suffers direct loss, this cannot be claimed
            from Microsoft (and not from you as a SaaS provider, unless you except
            such liability after all). Even if you have excepted such liability,
            this does not prevent end-customer the possibility to claim damages from
            Microsoft in a GDPR Art 82, nr 5 situation (end-customer is held jointly
            liable for damages towards data subjects, where both end-customer and
            Microsoft causes the breach.
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Suspension and termination.</strong> In addition to above, since you are the Customer in this set-up,
        and (according to the Hosting exception) since you are “<em>responsible
            for that (end customer) use”</em> and for ensuring that <em>“these terms
            and the terms and conditions of Customer’s volume licensing agreement
            are met by that use”</em>, this means that if one of your end customers
        breaches the Microsoft Customer Agreement (for instance Acceptable Use
        Policy, Export control or Use Restrictions), this will be considered a
        <strong>breach by you towards Microsoft</strong>, and Microsoft may <strong>suspend and/or
        terminate the online-services towards you, and all of your end users</strong>.
        The wording relating to suspension or termination does not distinguish
        between your different end-customers, but only addresses suspension or
        termination against you as the one and only customer.
        <p>
            Looking at the wording related to termination for cause, it states
            that: <em>”either party may terminate this Agreement on 30 days’ notice
                for material breach if the other party fails to cure the breach within
                the 30-day notice period”.</em> E.g if one of your end-customer breaches
            Microsofts T&amp;Cs, and fails to cure within the days, this will
            terminate your agreement with Microsoft, and also affect all other
            end-customers.</p>

        <p>Looking at the wording related to suspension, it states in the
            Acceptable Use Policy that: <em>“Violation of the Acceptable Use Policy
                in this section may result in suspension of the Online Service. If
                Microsoft suspends the Online Service, Microsoft will suspend only to
                the extent reasonably necessary. Unless Microsoft believes an immediate
                suspension is required, Microsoft will provide reasonable notice before
                suspending an Online Service for the reasons stated above”.</em> E.g if
            one end-customer is in breach of the AUP, Microsoft will if the breach
            has significant impact for Microsoft or the security of the
            Online-services, suspend your account immediately. This will affect all
            end-customers, and not only the end-customer in breach. If immediately
            suspension is not required, you will be notified, and you will hopefully
            have time to suspend the applicable customer/or allow the applicable
            end-customer to correct, before Microsoft suspends all services. As
            Microsoft does not know which end-customers you as a SaaS supplier may
            have, one cannot rely on Microsoft suspending only the relevant
            end-customer. Risk of <strong>domino effect</strong>.</p>

        <blockquote class="mitigation">
            <strong>Mitigations to consider:</strong> This risk for domino
            effect, may be assessed by some potential end-customers and be
            considered as a showstopper, for instance if the SaaS is business
            critical/important for life and health. You should therefor assess how
            you can limit the risks in this respect.
            <p>As for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Export control;</strong> always include similar
                    contractual wording in your agreement towards end users, and also make
                    necessary investigations to ensure that end customers use will not be in
                    breach of said regulations (before contracting and during the agreement
                    term).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use restrictions;</strong> design your SaaS offering so
                    end customer have no possibility to reverse engineer Azure services. E.g
                    do not allow your end-customers access to the Azure portal, design your
                    SaaS offering so it’s protected against unauthorized access, perform
                    penetration testing to verify that appropriate security measures are
                    established and maintained, and also build in protection against “denial
                    of services" attacks in your SaaS offering. Ensure also that end
                    customer is not allowed to share your SaaS offering with third parties
                    that does not use it only for the purpose of the applicable end
                    customers business purpose. The latter should be ensured in your
                    contract with the end-customer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acceptable Use Policy,</strong> in order to prevent end
                    customers storing illegal content in Azure, processing content that
                    infringes or violates third party rights, using the online services for
                    illegal purposes or to spam and distribute malware, are using in a way
                    that may harm the Online-services or anyone else’s use of it, or use
                    Azure to host applications where failure in Azure could lead to death or
                    bodily injury etc, you should design the solution so it’s not possible
                    to do the above. For instance, you should to the greatest extent code
                    your application so these actions cannot be done via your SaaS solution,
                    and also design your SaaS so it monitors and detects individual
                    end-customer violations of the above, enabling you to suspend such
                    end-customers as soon as possible in case of breach of the
                    AUP.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This risk for “domino effect” can however also be removed, if you
            have the opportunity to install the software offered as SaaS, on a
            unique tenant per end-customer. For instance that you enter into one
            customer agreement with Microsoft, per end-customer you contract with,
            which removes the risk of one end-customer breaching Microsoft T&amp;C’s
            with detrimental effect for you and your other end-customers.</p>

<p>The risks accounted for above, are also risks that on some level
    applies for you as a SaaS supplier hosting in Azure, and which should be
    assessed by you.</p>
<p>In addition, you should also review the terms and conditions of the
    Microsoft Customer Agreement, and assess the general risks therein, and
    assess how you possible can mitigate them. See our review of Microsoft
