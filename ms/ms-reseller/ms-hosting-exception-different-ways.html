<h1>Different ways to use the «hosting exception” </h1>

<p>As the basis for the “hosting exception”, is that you are a customer
  yourself of Microsoft’s online services, you should also consider under
  which Microsoft program you should subscribe. There are several
  different ways/programs to subscribe to Microsoft’s online services as a
  customer:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Agreement</th>
    <th>Eligibility</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Enterprise Agreement (EA).</td>
    <td>Can be used when you qualify for this.
      You need 500 SL’s or more (users and/or devices). Has traditionally been
      used when buying traditional software licenses, but has for several
      years also covered online services. Normally you lock the subscription
      for 3 year periods at the time, and you get pricing based on a scaled
      volume discount system. You also have a “true-up” once a year, where you
      add/pay for additional users/devices etc (without an order as such). For
      software licenses its normally a limited possibility to scale down,
      while it is to some extent possible for online services once a year.
      Payment for the committed consumption is upfront in full. The big
      “minus” with this agreement is that it consists of many different
      agreement documents, and is highly complex. But if you need to negotiate
      the terms, this is the program where Microsoft offers this as a
      possibility. Note that private entities are not allowed any longer to
      subscribe to Azure services under the EA program, so unless you are an
      existing EA customer, this alternative is not available (nor upon
      renewal).</td>

  <tr class="even">
    <td>Government Enterprise Agreement (EA)</td>
    <td>can be used when you have 250
      SL’s or more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)</td>
    <td>directly with Microsoft (MS
      Enterprise)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td>Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) through a reseller (MCA
      Indirect).</td>
    <td>The CSP program does not have a 3-year commitment as the EA,
      but billing is as a main rule done on a month by month basis; e.g its
      easier to scale up and down, and as a general rule you pay your
      consumption monthly in arrears (but options are available. Commitment is
      needed to get good discounts). Your reseller/CSP will bill you and
      support you in case of incidents, SLA downtime, guide you as to
      optimizing your consumption/prices etc.</td>

    <td>Microsoft Online Services Agreement (MOSA).</td>

      Microsoft is in process of abandoning this agreement type.</td>
