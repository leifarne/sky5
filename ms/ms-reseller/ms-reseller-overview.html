<h2>MPA (Direct / Indirect) </h2>

<p>When you enter into a Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), you'll get authorization to resell Microsoft Onlines
    Services to end customer. The MPA defines your reseller rights and obligations as a Cloud Solution Partner, also
    called CSP. </p>

<p>There are two main ways to become a CSP and resell Microsoft Azure Online Services to customers, either through a
    Direct Bill or Indirect Reseller.</p>

<h3>1. MPA Direct Bill </h3>

    <table style="width: 700;margin: 10px;">
        <tbody>
            <tr >
                <td >The MPA "Tier 1 / Direct bill" allows you to order online services from and interact directly
                        with Microsoft. </td>
                <td ><img width="250" src="media/skjermbilde-2023-09-25-094349.png" alt=""></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

<h3>2. MPA Indirect Reseller </h3>

    <table style="width: 700;margin: 10px;">
        <tbody>
            <tr >
                <td>The MPA "Tier 2/ Indirect Reseller" allows you to order online services for your end
                        customers via a distributor which has signed the MPA Direct Bill and which is authorized to have
                        resellers.</td>
                <td><img width="250" src="media/skjermbilde-2023-08-24-134552-1.png" alt=""></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <blockquote>
        <p style="background-color:#fcf2eb;">As an indirect reseller you do not have to
                establish your own portal / solution to communicate with Microsoft Partner Portal in order to establish
                end customer accounts/tenants, but you do it via your Distributor's portal (and you need to enter into a
                separate agreement with the Distributor to contract this as a right). In the latter you do not pay
                directly to Microsoft but you pay your distributor what your end customers have consumed.</p>

<h2>The Hosting Exception </h2>

    <table style="border-style:none;border-width:0px">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>The exception is applicable if you are a customer of Microsoft Online Services yourself, and you
                    have built a so called Customer Solution (meaning you have developed or are licensed to offer an
                    application as a service) and you use Microsoft Azure Services as your hosting platform. <br><br>In
                    this situation you do not have to become (enroll) as a CSP and enter into a Microsoft Partner
                    Agreement, but you use the Hosting exception in your own customer agreement with Microsoft as the
                    legal basis to resell Microsoft Online services. E.g. it allows you to share the power of online
                    services to third parties, which is normally not allowed.</td>
                <td><img style="width: 250px" src="media/nic_1988-1.jpg" alt=""></td>
            </tr>

    </table>

    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>The hosting exception applies only when you offer an application (SaaS) to end customers as
                        such, and not if Microsoft Azure services are disconnected from the SaaS offering as such (for
                        instance buy Office 365 or allow your end customers to order additional capacity so they may
                        host its own applications etc). Hosting exception is often used for multitenant solutions, where
                        you as the SaaS provider (and Customer of Microsoft), controls the Microsoft tenant.
