<h2>MPA (Direct / Indirect) </h2>

<p>When you enter into a Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), you'll get authorization to resell Microsoft Online
    Services to end customers. The MPA defines your reseller rights and obligations as a Cloud Solution Partner, also
    called CSP. </p>

<p>There are two main ways to become a CSP and resell Microsoft Azure Online Services to customers, either through a
    Direct Bill or as an Indirect Reseller.</p>

<h3>1. MPA Direct Bill </h3>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The MPA "Tier 1 / Direct bill" allows you to order online services from and interact directly
            with Microsoft. </td>
        <td class="decor"><img src="media/direct-bill-model.png" width="260"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>2. MPA Indirect Reseller </h3>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The MPA "Tier 2/ Indirect Reseller" allows you to order online services for your end
            customers via a distributor which has signed the MPA Direct Bill and which is authorized to have
            resellers.</td>
        <td class="decor"><img src="media/indirect-reseller-model.png" width="260"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<blockquote>
    <p>As an indirect reseller you do not have to
        establish your own portal / solution to communicate with Microsoft Partner Portal in order to establish
        end customer accounts/tenants, but you do it via your Distributor's portal (and you need to enter into a
        separate agreement with the Distributor to contract this as a right). In the latter case you do not pay
        directly to Microsoft but you pay your distributor what your end customers have consumed.</p>

<h2>The Hosting Exception </h2>

<table style="border-style:none;border-width:0px">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>This exception is applicable if you are a customer of Microsoft Online Services yourself, and you
                have built a so called Customer Solution (meaning you have developed or are licensed to offer an
                application as a service) and you use Microsoft Azure Services as your hosting platform. <br><br>In
                this situation you do not have to become (enroll as) a CSP and enter into a Microsoft Partner
                Agreement, but you use the Hosting exception in your own customer agreement with Microsoft as the
                legal basis to resell Microsoft Online services. E.g. it allows you to share the power of online
                services with third parties, which is normally not allowed.</td>
            <td class="decor"><img src="media/nic_1988-1.jpg" width="260"></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>The hosting exception applies only when you offer an application (SaaS) to end customers as
                such, and not if Microsoft Azure services are disconnected from the SaaS offering as such (for
                instance subscribe to Office 365 only or allow your end customers to order additional capacity so they may
                host their own applications etc). Hosting exception is often used for multitenant solutions, where
                you and the SaaS provider (and as a Customer of Microsoft) control the Microsoft tenant.
