<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<p>Many software companies that offer SaaS to their end-customers, use
  Azure to hosting its applications. In order to use Azure to host your
  application and offer SaaS to your end-customers there are two ways to
  contract with Microsoft:</p>
<h2 id="you-as-a-regular-microsoft-cloud-solution-partner">You as a
  regular Microsoft Cloud Solution Partner</h2>
<p><img src="media/way1.png" width="750" /></p>
<h2 id="you-as-a-saas-provider-using-the-hosting-exeption">You as a
  SaaS-provider using the Hosting Exeption</h2>
<p><img src="media/way2.png" width="750" /></p>
<p>As a <strong>customer of Microsoft</strong>, the main rule is that
  you are not allowed to share the services with third parties.
  <strong>The “hosting exception”</strong> however allow you to use Azure
  as your hosting platform, provided your product to end-customers are not
  the Microsoft Online-services as such, but access to a “Customer
  Solution” such as your own <strong>software application as a
    service</strong>. As your end-customers do not get access to Microsoft
  Online-services as such, this is allowed by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>In this situation you do not have to become a reseller (CSP) and
  enter into a Microsoft Partner Agreement, but you use the “hosting
  exception” in your own <strong>customer agreement with
    Microsoft</strong> as the legal basis to utilize Microsoft Online
  services and offer <strong>SaaS to end-customers</strong>. It is not a
  resale as such. The “hosting exception” is often used by SaaS suppliers
  for <strong>multitenant</strong> SaaS offerings.</p>

Walkthrough&quot;.
It also accounts for the benefits and risk with becoming a CSP or using the hosting exception for you as a SaaS
provider.
