# Different ways to use the "hosting exception"

As the basis for the **"hosting exception", is that you are a customer
yourself of Microsoft's online services**, you should also consider which
way (program) you should become a customer. There are several different
ways/programs to **subscribe to Microsoft's online services:**

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Agreement</th>
            <th>Eligibility</th>
        </tr>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
           <td>Entreprise Agreement (EA)</td>
           <td> EA can be used when you qualify for this. You need 500 SL's or more (users and/or devices). Has traditionally been used when buying traditional software licenses, but has for several years also covered online services. Normally you lock the subscription for 3 year periods at the time, and you get pricing based on a scaled volume discount system. You also have a "true-up" once a year, where you add/pay for additional users/devices etc (without an order as such). For software licenses its normally limited possibility to scale down, while it is to some extent possible for online services once a year. Payment for the committed consumption is upfront in full. The big "minus" with this agreement is that it consists of many different agreement documents, and is highly complex. But if you need to negotiate the terms, this is the program where Microsoft offers this as a possibility. The EA program is not available for most private entities, only public entities. </td>

          <tr> 
            <td>Government Entreprise Agreement (EA)</td> 
            <td>Government EA can be used when you have 250 SL's or more.</td>

          <tr> 
               <td>Microsoft Customer Agreement (MS MCA)</td> 
                <td> MS MCA directly with Microsoft </td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
             <td>Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)</td> 
             <td> CSP MCA through a reseller (Cloud Solution Provider MCA). The CSP program does not have a 3-year commitment as the EA, but is done on a month by month basis; e.g its easier to scale up and down, and as a general rule you pay your consumption monthly in arrears (but options are available). Your reseller/CSP will bill you and support you in case of incidents, SLA downtime, guide you as to optimizing your consumption/prices etc.</td>
