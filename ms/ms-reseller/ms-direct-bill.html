<h1>Key Risks for Direct Bill</h1>

<p>To obtain the right to resell Microsoft Online Services you must enter into the Microsoft Partner Agreement
    (hereinafter referred to as MPA) with Microsoft. This is our review of the MPA for “Direct bill”, which is the
    contract version applicable to resellers (Cloud Service Provider, “CSP”) who are authorized to order directly from
    Microsoft and where the reseller establishes its own technical solutions for ordering and settling directly through
    Microsoft's Partner Portal.</p>

<p>The review does not cover the version of the Microsoft Partner Agreement (referred to here as MPA, Indirect reseller)
    that applies to resellers that acquire the right to sell through a distributor (ala Arrow, Crayon, etc.).</p>

<blockquote>
    Note that if it
    is desired for various reasons, you may be both CSP Direct Bill, and at the same time enter into an agreement
    with a distributor, so that you may resell as an Indirect reseller.
</blockquote>

<p>The main difference between MPA "Direct Bill" and MPA "Indirect reseller" is mainly that the MPA "Direct Bill" has
    several provisions related to ordering from Microsoft, payment regulations, etc. For the most part, the balance is
    similar, except that a " Direct Bill" reseller may, upon termination of the agreement, continue to resell the Online
    Services to active customers in accordance with the termination for convenience&nbsp; clause under the applicable
    end customer's MCA or maximum for 12 months, while an " Indirect Reseller" must stop all resale the same day. In
    addition the incentive models for a " Direct Bill" reseller are better than for an " Indirect Reseller".</p>

<p>The Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) consists of four documents ("Core Terms", "Channel Terms", "Channel
    Authorization" and the "Guide to Online Services and Software Channel Authorization") that must be accepted. This is
    done by signing an "Enrollment" with Microsoft, which corresponds to an order form, and is normally executed via the
    Microsoft’s Partner Portal. This constitutes the "agreement":</p>

<p>In addition, is also required to enter into the Microsoft Partner Network Agreement (MPN) with Microsoft, which
    &nbsp;allows you to become a member of the Microsoft Partner Network. This is thus a prerequisite for having a valid
    Microsoft Partner Agreement. This separate agreement provides access to the Microsoft Partner Portal, where you can
    find relevant information, offers (can participate in promotions, etc.), can make orders, etc. The Microsoft Partner
    Network Agreement also has additional terms that apply if you wish to be an advisor to customers and potential
    customers.</p>

<p>It consists of:</p>

<p>In addition to the Microsoft Partner Agreement and Microsoft Partner Network Agreement, Microsoft Partner Agreement
    states that the Microsoft Customer Agreement is also applicable to you as a reseller, if you use or resell the MS
    Online services “Azure Partner Shared Services” or “Microsoft Azure Stack Hub Offer Terms”. Therefore, you should
    review which rights and obligations the Microsoft Customer Agreement imposes on you in such situations.</p>

<p>A detailed review of the Microsoft Partner Agreement, including Core Terms, Channel Terms, Channel and the Guide to
    Channel Authorization follows under Detailed Walkthrough. Each of the sections provides a general description of
    what each document regulates. In the review we have categorized all comments in three categories:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Obligations where you should establish procedures to ensure compliance</li>

    <li>Note</li>

    <li>Obligations that should be mirrored towards the end customers</li>
</ol>

<h1>Key findings in the Microsoft Partner Agreement</h1>

<h2>Relationship with the end customers</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The reseller is obliged to ensure that customers accept Microsoft's terms and conditions and confirm this in the
        Microsoft Partner Portal for each customer. The Microsoft Customer Agreement and associated terms (Product
        Terms, SLA, DPA, etc.) must thus be flowed down to the reseller's own customers in the agreement entered into
        between you as the reseller and the individual end customer, so it establishes a direct agreement between
        Microsoft and the individual end customer. Since the end customers’ acceptance of the Microsoft terms and
        conditions establishes a (separate) direct agreement between Microsoft and each individual end customer, both
        Microsoft and each individual end customer may be able to enforce rights and obligations in relation to each
        other directly. This means that the reseller will not be held liable by Microsoft for any breach of contract by
        an individual end customer.</li>

    <li>The reseller is obliged to ensure that all orders, both when establishing its end customer agreement and
        subsequent additional orders, are made in writing and can be documented to Microsoft. This includes the duration
        of the Services. This is referred to as the "Customer Purchase Commitment" in the MPA.</li>

    <li>Although a direct agreement is entered into between Microsoft and each individual end customer, the reseller
        remains responsible for payment for all consumption of the online services made by each individual customer,
        regardless of whether the reseller receives payment from the individual end customer or not.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may reject new customers for legal reasons or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the
        Customer will increase the risk for Microsoft. Microsoft may also suspend or terminate end customer
        subscriptions in accordance with law, or regulations in the MPA or &nbsp;MCA (e.g. if the customer is in
        breach).</li>

    <li>Microsoft is not obligated to accept orders or accept desired quantity or future supplemental orders. Therefore,
        you should notify Microsoft of potential orders, to ensure availability. This is especially important in case of
        large volume orders.</li>

    <li>The reseller must establish help desk/support for own customers to whom it resells, and must ensure that
        customers do not contact Microsoft directly. When customers contact the reseller in connection with errors, the
        reseller must set an initial categorization of the error.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commercial aspects</h2>

<ul>
    <li>In principle, the reseller may agree on the term of the services with the end customer, but for some services
        Microsoft requests lock-in periods. And for some services, there is an automatic renewal after the end of the
        subscription period. The reseller must check this for each service it resells.</li>

    <li>If a lock-in period/minimum quantity is agreed for a end customer, this must be paid by the reseller even if the
        reseller’s agreement ceases due to a material breach by the reseller itself or due to a material breach of the
        MCA by the end customer, or if the end customer terminates the agreement with the reseller without cause before
        the lock-in period is over.</li>

    <li>In principle, the reseller determines the prices for each end customers unless MS gives discounts to public
        customers, which in that case must be given to the customers in full (as opposed to Partner Earned Credits,
        which the reseller retains entirely itself). Unless Microsoft provides discounts to individual customers, the
        reseller shall pay for the consumed quantity at applicable prices in accordance with the "Price List." The list
        price may be changed with 30 days' notice, or sooner for non-Microsoft products.</li>

    <li>The reseller can earn bonuses, by earning discounts on upcoming invoices. Such Partner Earned Credit is not a
        "discount" that must be shared with customers. The calculation of such earned discounts may be based on
        activities and information provided by the reseller itself, or via indirect resellers you are licensed to resell
        sell through (i.e. you have to become a distributor, so other CSPs may order online services for their own
        customers through you), or end customers. It is important that the reseller shares the necessary information in
        accordance with Microsoft's requirements. The "Partner Earned Credit" is normally 15%.</li>

    <li>The fees payable is based on consumption measurements made by Microsoft itself.</li>

    <li>As a general rule, Microsoft invoices every month, and the invoices are payable within 60 days. Note that there
        is a 25 day’s period for notifying Microsoft if you disagree with the consumption measurements Microsoft itself
        uses as the basis for the fees the reseller must pay to Microsoft each month. Also note that, even if you notify
        within the deadline, you must still pay Microsoft the invoiced amount, otherwise you risk suspension or
        termination for cause. Thus, it is not allowed to withhold any payment or set-off, etc. The agreement does not
        impose any deadline on Microsoft as to how quickly they shall repay if they invoice too much.</li>

    <li>Note also that Microsoft may have a "credit limit", so orders for online services exceeding this limit may be
        declined, unless you obtain consent in each individual case.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Predictability / legal</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The terms of the Channel Terms and Channel Authorization are subject to change by Microsoft with 180 days'
        notice, while the Guide to Channel Authorization is subject to change with 30 days' notice. Therefore, you
        should monitor changes that are introduced.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may terminate the MPA for convenience/the right to resell with 30 days' written notice. You then loses
        the right to resell and must transfer existing customers to another reseller or Microsoft. However, you may
        still resell to active customers during the notice period, as long as the termination takes place within maximum
        12 months. This should be mirrored towards end customers.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may further change or remove products from Online Services with 30 days' notice. This also should be
        mirrored towards end customers.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may terminate the agreement due to a "breach", and it is not required that this breach is "material."
        If the breach is not remedied within 30 days, Microsoft may terminate for cause, and you will then lose the
        right to resell to new customers immediately and to existing customers within 12 months. Microsoft may also
        claim damages for any loss.</li>

    <li>Termination for cause may also take place immediately (without deadline/right to remedy the breach) in the event
        of a breach of confidentiality, breach of Microsoft's IPR, or non-compliance with business conduct requirements
        (compliance with laws and regulations concerning for example anti-corruption, training, etc.). Termination for
        cause may also take place immediately without the right to remedy if previous breaches occur again. This
        emphasizes the importance of keeping track of all obligations, which is the purpose of this review.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may also stop access to the Microsoft Partner Portal and other systems and tools if the reseller is in
        material breach. Unlike termination for cause, the threshold here is “material breach”. However, Microsoft will
        notify in advance of such suspension only when it is "reasonable."</li>

    <li>Note that the normal limitation of liability (capped at 100% and limited against indirect loss) does not apply
        to unauthorized use of the other’s IPR, resale in violation of the provisions of the agreement, breach of
        compliance obligations or breach of confidentiality duty. This means that the reseller's liability for the most
        practical purposes is unlimited, which underlines the need to comply with the obligations of the agreement.</li>

    <li>The contracting party is mainly Microsoft Ireland, and Irish law is the choice of law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routines that should be established</h2>

<p>The MPA contains several compliance obligations. Since non-compliance can result in both suspension and/or
    termination for cause, as well as unlimited liability for damages, it is important to familiarize yourself with and
    comply with these obligations. For instance:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Microsoft's Trademark and Brand Guidelines for use of Microsoft trademarks</li>

    <li>Detailed business integrity requirements such as compliance with export control rules, legislation related to
        environmental protection, IPR, HSE, anti-corruption legislation, anti-money laundering rules, internal control
        rules (e.g. under GDPR), bookkeeping obligations, etc.</li>

    <li>Requirements for completion of Microsoft training in anti-corruption</li>

    <li>Compliance with Microsoft's own code of conduct</li>

    <li>Requirements for reporting. There is a risk that orders may be suspended or that payment may be withheld in case
        of noncompliance with these requirements.</li>

    <li>Requirements for complete documentation of the reseller's fulfilment of its obligations under the MPA, including
        information about customers, orders, quantities, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy and Data protection</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Each party acts as&nbsp;data controller with respect to any personal data exchanged between the reseller and
        Microsoft under the Microsoft Partner Agreement. The nature, purpose and category of personal data must be
        stated in the specific form filled out when the reseller register as a reseller. The reseller must ensure that
        it has a legal basis to be the controller of that personal data and to disclose any such personal data to
        Microsoft.</li>

    <li>Customer data shall be defined in the individual customer agreement. Prior to receiving customer data, which is
        also personal data, the reseller shall ensure that both the reseller and Microsoft have a legal basis for
        processing such personal data. The reseller and Microsoft will be independent processors for processing of such
        personal data. This means that Microsoft will not be a subcontracted processor of the reseller, but the reseller
        is responsible for establishing a basis for Microsoft being a data processor. Therefore, the reseller must
        ensure that the customer agreement is concluded, so that a data processing agreement is established between the
        customer and Microsoft. If the reseller also processes this personal data, a data processing agreement between
        the reseller and the customer must also be established.</li>
</ul>

<h1> Key findings in the Microsoft Partner Network Agreement </h1>

<ul>
    <li>The right to resell Microsoft Online services presupposes a valid Microsoft Partner Network Agreement. Microsoft
        may terminate the Microsoft Partner Agreement for cause in the event of breach of the Network Agreement.</li>

    <li>The Network agreement may be terminated by Microsoft without cause with 30 days' notice. If the Network
        agreement is terminated, the Microsoft Partner Agreement will also terminate automatically.</li>

    <li>Termination for cause may take place immediately in the event of non-compliance with/breach of duties such as
        Privacy and Data protection, Confidentiality, Business Integrity Principles, breach of the other's IPR, or other
        breach that cannot be remedied within a reasonable time. There is no requirement that the breach of contract
        must be material or that you are given the opportunity to remedy such breach. Since the Microsoft Partner
        Network Agreement is a prerequisite for the Microsoft Partner Agreement, this entails an increased risk that the
        Microsoft Partner Agreement may terminate, compared to what follows from the Microsoft Partner Agreement alone.
        Again, this underlines the importance of having under control all obligations in the agreement and creating
        procedures for complying with these obligations.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may modify the Microsoft Partner Network Agreement, Microsoft materials (content, information, sales
        tools, documentation, marketing materials such as logos, etc.) or a program (offers, incentives, promotions,
        etc.) etc. with 30 days' written notice.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the above key findings demonstrate, the reseller in this contractual relationship has relatively little
    predictability in the T&amp;C’s while having extensive obligations. In the following you will find our detailed
    review of each individual agreement document, as well as our suggestions as to how to manage the risks. The risks
    may be managed either by establishing internal procedures to ensure compliance with the obligations or by mirroring
    risks or obligations in the agreements with its own end customers.</p>

<blockquote>
    NOTE – the purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the rights and obligations in these agreements
    and thus help you to understand them as a whole. It is not easy to make a summary that would address all the
    details of the terms and conditions in a way that would cover all resellers’ needs, so you should also read
    through the terms and conditions in their entirety if you want to maintain full control.
