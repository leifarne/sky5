<h1>Key Risks for Direct Bill</h1>

<p>To obtain the right to resell Microsoft Online Services you must enter into the Microsoft Partner Agreement
    (hereinafter referred to as MPA) with Microsoft. This is our review of the MPA for "Direct bill", which is the
    contract version applicable to resellers (Cloud Service Provider, "CSP") who are authorized to order directly from
    Microsoft and where the reseller establishes its own technical solutions for ordering and settling directly through
    Microsoft's Partner Portal.</p>

<p>The review does not cover the version of the Microsoft Partner Agreement (referred to here as MPA, Indirect reseller)
    that applies to resellers that acquire the right to sell through a distributor (ala Arrow, Crayon, etc.).</p>

<blockquote>
    Note that if it is desired for various reasons, you may be both CSP Direct Bill and a CSP Indirect reseller.
</blockquote>

<p>The main difference between MPA "Direct Bill" and MPA "Indirect reseller" is that the MPA "Direct Bill" has
    several provisions related to ordering from Microsoft, payment regulations, etc. For the most part, the balance is
    similar, except that a "Direct Bill" reseller may, upon termination for convenience of the agreement, continue to
    resell the Online Services to active customers either in accordance with the committed agreement term towards 
    existing end customers or for a
    maximum for of 12 months, while an "Indirect Reseller" must stop all resale the same day. In addition, the
    incentive models for a "Direct Bill" reseller are better than for an "Indirect Reseller".</p>

<p>The Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) consists of four documents ("Core Terms", "Channel Terms", "Channel
    Authorization" and the "Guide to Online Services and Software Channel Authorization") that must be accepted. This is
    done by signing an "Enrollment" with Microsoft, which corresponds to an order form, and is normally executed via the
    Microsoft's Partner Portal. This constitutes the "agreement":</p>

<p>In addition, it is also required to enter into the Microsoft Partner Network Agreement (MPN) with Microsoft, which
    allows you to become a member of the Microsoft Partner Network. This is a prerequisite for having a valid Microsoft
    Partner Agreement. This separate agreement provides access to the Microsoft Partner Portal, where you can find
    relevant information, offers (can participate in promotions, etc.), can make orders, etc. The Microsoft Partner
    Network Agreement also has additional terms that apply if you wish to be an advisor to customers and potential
    customers. </p>

<p>The Microsoft Partner Network Agreement consists of:</p>

<figure><img src="media/mpna-db.png" width="600" alt="mpna-db" /></figure>

<p>In addition to the Microsoft Partner Agreement and Microsoft Partner Network Agreement, Microsoft Partner Agreement
    states that the Microsoft Customer Agreement is also applicable to you as a reseller, if you use or resell the
    Microsoft Online services "Azure Partner Shared Services" or "Microsoft Azure Stack Hub Offer Terms". Therefore, you
    should review which rights and obligations the Microsoft Customer Agreement imposes on you in such situations.</p>

<p>A detailed review of the Microsoft Partner Agreement, including Core Terms, Channel Terms, Channel and the Guide to
    Channel Authorization follows under Detailed Walkthrough. Each of the sections provides a general description of
    what each document regulates. In the review we have categorized all comments in three categories:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Obligations where you should establish procedures to ensure compliance</li>

    <li>Note - specific clauses you should be aware of and consider</li>

    <li>Obligations that should be mirrored towards the end customers</li>
</ol>

<h1>Key findings in the Microsoft Partner Agreement</h1>

<h2><img src="media/hjelp.png" width="40" style="color:#A33F1F" />Relationship with the end customers</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The reseller is obliged to ensure that customers accept Microsoft's terms and conditions and confirm this in the
        Microsoft Partner Portal for each customer. The Microsoft Customer Agreement and associated terms (Product
        Terms, SLA, DPA, etc.) must thus be flowed down to the reseller's own customers in the agreement entered into
        between you as the reseller and the individual end customer, so it establishes a direct agreement between
        Microsoft and the individual end customer. Since the end customers' acceptance of the Microsoft terms and
        conditions establishes a (separate) direct agreement between Microsoft and each individual end customer, both
        Microsoft and each individual end customer may be able to enforce rights and obligations in relation to each
        other directly. This means that the reseller will not be held liable by Microsoft for any breach of contract by
        an individual end customer.</li>

    <li>The reseller is obliged to ensure that all orders, both when establishing its end customer agreement and
        subsequent additional orders, are made in writing and can be documented to Microsoft. This includes the duration
        of the Services. This is referred to as the "Customer Purchase Commitment" in the MPA.</li>

    <li>Although a direct agreement is entered into between Microsoft and each individual end customer, the reseller
        remains responsible for payment of all consumption of the online services made by each individual customer,
        regardless of whether the reseller receives payment from the individual end customer or not. </li>

    <li>Microsoft may reject new customers for legal reasons or if Microsoft has reasonable grounds to believe that
        the Customer will increase the risk for Microsoft. Microsoft may also suspend or terminate end customer
        subscriptions in accordance with law, or regulations in the MPA or MCA (e.g. if the customer is in breach).</li>

    <li>Microsoft is not obligated to accept orders or accept desired quantity or future supplemental orders.
        Therefore, you should notify Microsoft of potential future orders, and ensure commitment of availability. This
        is especially important in case of large volume orders.</li>

    <li>The reseller must establish help desk/support for own customers to whom it resells and must ensure that
        customers do not contact Microsoft directly. When customers contact the reseller in connection with errors, the
        reseller must set an initial categorization of the error. </li>
</ul>

<h2><img src="media/vekst.png" width="40" /> Commercial aspects</h2>

<ul>
    <li>In principle, the reseller may agree on the term of the services with the end customer, but for some services
        Microsoft requests lock-in periods. And for some services, there is an automatic renewal after the end of the
        subscription period. The reseller must check this for each service it resells.</li>

    <li>If a lock-in period/minimum quantity is agreed for an end customer, this must be paid by the reseller even if
        the reseller's agreement ceases due to a material breach by the reseller itself or due to a material breach of
        the MCA by the end customer, or if the end customer terminates the agreement with the reseller without cause
        before the lock-in period is over. </li>

    <li>In principle, the reseller determines the prices for each end customers unless Microsoft gives discounts to
        public customers. Such discounts must be given to the public customers in full (as opposed to Partner Earned
        Credits, which the reseller retains entirely itself). The reseller shall pay for the consumed services at
        applicable prices in accordance with the "Price List" (or such discounted price as given by Microsoft to
        individual customer). The list price may be changed with 30 days' notice for Microsoft products, but sooner for
        non-Microsoft products. </li>

    <li>The reseller can earn bonuses, by earning discounts on upcoming invoices. Such Partner Earned Credit is not a
        "discount" that must be shared with customers. The calculation of such earned discounts may be based on
        activities reported by the reseller itself, or via indirect resellers you are licensed to resell sell through
        (i.e. you have to become a distributor, so other CSPs may order online services for their own customers through
        you), or by the end customers. It is important that the reseller shares the necessary information in accordance
        with Microsoft's requirements. The "Partner Earned Credit" is normally 15%. </li>

    <li>The fees payable is based on consumption measurements made by Microsoft itself.</li>

    <li>As a general rule, Microsoft invoices every month, and the invoices are payable within 60 days. Note that there
        is a 25 day's period for notifying Microsoft if you disagree with the consumption measurements Microsoft itself
        uses as the basis for the fees the reseller must pay to Microsoft each month. Also note that, even if you notify
        within the deadline, you must still pay Microsoft the invoiced amount, otherwise you risk suspension or
        termination for cause. Thus, it is not allowed to withhold any payment or set-off, etc. The agreement does not
        impose any deadline on Microsoft as to how quickly they shall repay if they invoice too much.</li>

    <li>Note also that Microsoft may have a "credit limit", so orders for online services exceeding this limit may be
        declined, unless you obtain consent in each individual case.</li>
</ul>

<h2><img src="media/vekt.png" width="40" style="color:#A33F1F" /> Predictability / legal</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The terms of the Channel Terms and Channel Authorization are subject to change by Microsoft with 180 days'
        notice, while the Guide to Channel Authorization is subject to change with 30 days' notice. Therefore, you
        should monitor changes that are introduced.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may terminate the MPA for convenience with 30 days' written notice. You then lose the right to
        resell and must transfer existing customers to another reseller or Microsoft. However, you may still resell to
        active customers during the notice period and longer if you have committed a longer agreement term towards your
        existing end customers, as long as the resale stops within maximum 12 months. This should be mirrored towards
        end customers. </li>

    <li>Microsoft may further change or remove products from Online Services with 30 days' notice. This also should be
        mirrored towards end customers.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may terminate the agreement due to a "breach", and it is not required that this breach is
        "material." If the breach is not remedied within 30 days, Microsoft may terminate for cause, and you will then
        lose the right to resell immediately. Microsoft may also claim damages for any loss. Termination for cause may
        also take place immediately without the right to remedy if previous breaches occur again. </li>

    <li>In addition, termination for cause may take place immediately (and without a right to remedy the breach) in
        the event of a breach of confidentiality, breach of Microsoft's IPR, or non-compliance with business conduct
        requirements (i.e. compliance with laws and regulations concerning for example anti-corruption, training, etc.).
    </li>

    <li>Microsoft may also stop access to the Microsoft Partner Portal and other systems and tools if the reseller is
        in material breach. Unlike termination for cause, the threshold here is "material breach". However, Microsoft
        will notify in advance of such suspension only when it is "reasonable." E.g. the reseller will in such situation
        have no right to remedy.</li>

    <li>Note that the normal limitation of liability (capped at 100% of the fees paid to Microsoft the 12 preceding
        months and limited against indirect loss) does not apply to unauthorized use of the other's IPR, resale in
        violation of the provisions of the agreement, breach of compliance obligations or breach of confidentiality
        duty. This means that the reseller's liability for the most practical purposes is unlimited. </li>

    <li>The contracting party is mainly Microsoft Ireland, and Irish law is the choice of law.</li>
</ul>

<h2><img src="media/ring.png" width="40" style="color:#A33F1F" />Routines that should be established</h2>

<p>The MPA contains several compliance obligations. Since non-compliance can result in suspension and/or termination for
    cause, as well as unlimited liability for damages, it is important to familiarize yourself with and comply with
    these obligations. For instance:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Microsoft's Trademark and Brand Guidelines for use of Microsoft trademarks</li>

    <li>Detailed business integrity requirements such as compliance with export control rules, legislation related to
        environmental protection, IPR, HSE, anti-corruption legislation, anti-money laundering rules, internal control
        rules (e.g. under GDPR), bookkeeping obligations, etc.</li>

    <li>Requirements for completion of Microsoft training in anti-corruption</li>

    <li>Compliance with Microsoft's own code of conduct</li>

    <li>Requirements for reporting. There is a risk that orders may be suspended or that payment may be withheld in
        case of noncompliance with these reporting requirements. </li>

    <li>Requirements for complete documentation of the reseller's fulfilment of its obligations under the MPA, including
        information about customers, orders, quantities, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2><img src="media/sikkerhet.png" width="40" style="color:#A33F1F" />Privacy and Data protection</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Each party acts as&nbsp;data controller with respect to any personal data exchanged between the reseller and
        Microsoft under the Microsoft Partner Agreement. The nature, purpose and category of personal data must be
        stated in the specific form filled out when the reseller register as a reseller. The reseller must ensure that
        it has a legal basis to be the controller of that personal data and to disclose any such personal data to
        Microsoft.</li>

    <li>Customer data shall be defined in the individual customer agreement. Prior to receiving customer data that is
        personal data, the reseller shall ensure that both the reseller and Microsoft have a legal basis for processing
        such personal data. The reseller and Microsoft will be independent processors for processing of such
        personal data. This means that Microsoft will not be a subcontracted processor of the reseller, but the reseller
        is responsible for establishing a basis for Microsoft being a data processor. Therefore, the reseller must
        ensure that the customer agreement is concluded, so that a data processing agreement is established between the
        customer and Microsoft. If the reseller also processes this personal data, a data processing agreement between
        the reseller and the customer must also be established.</li>
</ul>

<h1> Key findings in the Microsoft Partner Network Agreement </h1>

<ul>
    <li>The right to resell Microsoft Online services presupposes a valid Microsoft Partner Network Agreement. Microsoft
        may terminate the Microsoft Partner Agreement for cause in the event of breach of the Network Agreement.</li>

    <li>The Microsoft Partner Network Agreement may be terminated by Microsoft without cause with 30 days' notice. If
        the Network agreement is terminated, the Microsoft Partner Agreement will also terminate automatically.</li>

    <li>Termination of the Microsoft Partner Network Agrement for cause, may have immediate effect, and without having
        the right to remedy, in the event of non-compliance with Privacy and Data protection, Confidentiality and/or
        Business Integrity Principles. This applies also in the event of breach of the other's IPR, or other breach that
        cannot be remedied within a reasonable time. There is no requirement that the non-compliance or the breach must
        be material. Since the Microsoft Partner Network Agreement is a prerequisite for the Microsoft Partner
        Agreement, this prerequisite entails an increased risk that the Microsoft Partner Agreement may terminate even
        though the reseller is not violating the Microsoft Partner Agreement as such. Again, this underlines the
        importance of having under control all obligations in the agreement and creating procedures for complying with
        these obligations.</li>

    <li>Microsoft may modify the Microsoft Partner Network Agreement, including Microsoft materials (content,
        information, sales tools, documentation, marketing materials such as logos, etc.) and a program (offers,
        incentives, promotions, etc.) etc., with 30 days' written notice.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the above key findings demonstrate, the reseller in this contractual relationship has relatively little
    predictability in the T&amp;C's while having extensive obligations. In the following you will find our detailed
    review of each individual agreement document, as well as our suggestions as to how to manage the risks. The risks
    may be managed either by establishing internal procedures to ensure compliance with the obligations or by mirroring
    risks or obligations in the agreements with your own end customers.</p>

<blockquote>
    NOTE - the purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the rights and obligations in these agreements
    and thus help you to understand them as a whole. It is not easy to make a summary that would address all the
    details of the terms and conditions in a way that would cover all resellers' needs, so you should also read
    through the terms and conditions in their entirety if you want to maintain full control.
