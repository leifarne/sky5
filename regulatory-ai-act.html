<blockquote> <strong>AI system</strong> means a <strong>machine-based system</strong> that is designed to operate with <strong>varying
levels of autonomy</strong> and that may <strong>exhibit adaptiveness after deployment</strong>, and that, for
explicit or implicit objectives, <strong>infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs</strong>
such as <strong>predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical
or virtual environments.</strong></blockquote>
