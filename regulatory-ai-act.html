    <h1>What is the AI Act?</h1>

<h1> Introduction to EU's AI Act</h1>

<h3> The AI Act is primarily a product safety regulation. This means that the regulation aims to ensure that AI systems placed, offered, or used within the EU market are reliable and require human involvementThe purpose of the AI Act is to promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy AI, while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights against harmful effects of AI system in the Union and supporting innovation.</h3>

<h2> Risk based approach</h2>

<p> The AI Act lays down a <strong> risk-based approach </strong> when categorizing AI systems into four different risk categories, with varying degrees of requirements. This approach acknowledges that not all AI systems pose the same level of risk and tailors regulations accordingly.</p>

<p>While some AI systems are considered so risky that the AI Act prohibits them, others are considered to have limited or minimal risk, requiring only a few obligations. The main part of AI Act focuses is obligations related to high-risk AI systems. It must be noted that only a few AI systems will be categorized as high-risk.</p>

<Strong> AI system definition </Strong>



<blockquote> <strong>AI system</strong> means a <strong>machine-based system</strong> that is designed to operate with <strong>varying
levels of autonomy</strong> and that may <strong>exhibit adaptiveness after deployment</strong>, and that, for
explicit or implicit objectives, <strong>infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs</strong>
such as <strong>predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical
or virtual environments.</strong></blockquote>

<h2> AI Act categorises AI according to its risk:</h2>
<ul> 
    <li> <strong> Unacceptable risk:</strong> Unacceptable risk is prohibited. AI systems that are unacceptable are social scoring systems and manipulative AI  </li> 


</ul>
