<p>As a Customer of cloud services, you should not only review the
    relevant hyperscalers subscription terms and conditions to have control
    over your rights and obligations.</p>
<p>Depending on the business sector you operate in, there may also be
    <strong>various laws and regulations you need to have control
        over</strong>, and that you need to be compliant with when using cloud
    services. This extends <strong>beyond GDPR.</strong>
</p>
<p>We therefore also provide an overview of regulatory requirements
    applicable to the average customer: - The Accounting act - The Archives
    act - The GDPR (data privacy)</p>
<p>And to a large extent also sector specific legislation, such as: -
    European Banking Association guidelines for bank and finance - EIOPA for
    insurance - NVE rules for energy - The Health Registry Act for hospitals
    etc.</p>
<p>In addition to such overview, we translate what it means that the
    <strong>Cloud T&amp;Cs should state/give you as rights as a
        customer</strong>, in order to be compliant.
</p>
<p>In addition to the regulatory overview you get, our risk assessment
    tool is configurable for different customer sectors, so if you for
    instance are a bank you can choose that compliance with EBA guidelines
    should be a part of the tool, so you can use that to assess/document
    compliance.</p>
