# What is the Cloud Terms Guide?

<img src="media/CTG.png" width="650"/> 

# Purpose

The Cloud Terms Guide will monitor and manage the risks and exposure to
the cloud contracts and terms from the cloud providers like Amazon,
Microsoft and Google. It can keep track of current mitigating actions
and resulting risk profile for you.

The contractual terms will be updated from time to time by the cloud
providers. The risk items with corresponding recommended mitigations
will be maintained by specialists from Føyen. The service will alert you 
when a risk has changed as a consequence of the providers' update
of their contractual terms. This can lead to your risk action
becoming invalid, or that the risk exposure has changed. You react to the 
alert and reassess the risk, mitigation and exposure.

# Benefits

You can maximize business benefits of the cloud while maintaining compliance and
transparency. New technology is released first on the cloud, and later
on traditional platforms. Don't miss out on the opportunities (AI,
analytics, infrastructure, security) that new technology offers.
Maximize your usage, avoid the pitfalls and stay in control.

-   Risk & Compliance for regulated companies and organizations. (Do we
    have control? What is our exposure?).

-   Traceability of actions (Who is responsible for the action?).

-   Is the mitigation proportional to the risk? Should the mitigation be
    addressed through the contract, finances, organization, process, or
    solution. What is the estimated cost to implement the mitigation?

-   Follow-up of risks and mitigations at the management level. (Have
    you done it?)

-   Financial write-up when the risk is no longer valid. (When does the
    risk expire? How much?)

The service will help you apply a Cloud First strategy. Segment
the solutions and go to the Cloud where possible. You can implement mitigations
that are proportional to the risk while maintaining control. Fall back
to on-prem when no adequate mitigations are possible.

# Usage

For each mitigating action you should assess Expected Loss
because of the residual risk remaining after the mitigation has been
implemented. That means the annual statistical expected value for cost
incurred *when* (not *if*) that particular risk occurs. If the residual
risk remaining is greater than Low, there should be an estimated for the
expected loss.

The mitigation could be addressed in five principally different ways -
in the contract, financials, organization, process or solution. If the
mitigation is addressed through the solution, the action must be
propagated into a *solution requirement*, and be handled
correspondingly. If the mitigation is financial, a *cost element* must
be reflected in a budget. If the mitigation is organizational or
processual, it must be defined as a responsibility for an
*organizational role* or defined in an *operational process
description*.

# Why do I need an online tool for this? 

Why not just use a spreadsheet or my existing risk management tool?

The risks in the Cloud Terms Guide are maintained by legal experts from
Føyen. They regularly monitor changes to the terms from the cloud
providers and update the online database, so that cloud risk management
becomes part of a digital process for the enterprise. The Cloud Terms
Guide works as Contract-as-a-Service.The CTG is a tool that is simple to
use for management purposes. Specific risks and mitigations can be
handled downstream operationally in the organization using a classic risk management tool.
