# Cloud subscription tool

Tip and hints for how to ensure good SaaS/IaaS/PaaS contracts:

When you are in process of procuring cloud offerings from cloud service providers, you should always review terms and
conditions, including possible license metrics, carefully before you contract, so you have control over your rights and
obligations. There are normally a huge number of “pitfalls”  or regulations with weak customer protection that you
should get control over.

Our cloud services procurement tool offering is, contrary to our IaaS/PaaS tool where we also provide detailed review of
the T&Cs for Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, “only” a detailed check list that you can
use when contracting cloud services from other cloud service providers such as IBM, Oracle, Alibaba, Salesforce, SAP,
Atlassian etc. Given the large number of different cloud providers / different T&C’s out there, we cannot offer detailed
reviews of all such T&Cs, but we can offer a detailed guideline of how risk and responsibility ideally should be
addressed from a customer perspective.

The check list both give you a tool to assess risk in the various cloud offerings you are considering, but it also helps
you to identify risks that you probably should not accept, what you should try to change in negotiations, and also how.

Since public cloud services normally are standardized, i.e you receive the same standard service as the other customers,
you should not try to change the T&Cs as it relates to the standard cloud offering as such. Then you are asking for a
customer specific solution, which will be more expensive. This however does not mean that you should not ensure
predictability for yourself as a customer.

Our high-level recommendation is that you for instance should not accept:

- No or limited price assurance, especially for SaaS offerings.

- License metrics that does not cover your affiliates, or which are not adapted to your way of doing business, so you risk
large increases in subscription fees when you start using the cloud solution in your entire business

- That the service may be materially changed without a sufficient notice period for you to plan for the
changes/updates/alternatives

- That modules/parts of the service may be terminated with short notice period, so you do not have enough time to plan for
an alternative

- That the cloud offering in general/your agreement may be terminated for convenience by the cloud provider with short
notice, so you do not have enough time to plan for an alternative

- That breach of the terms and conditions will entitle the cloud provider to suspend the services, without providing a
notice to you with a reasonable time limit to cure before suspension happens. Or when the suspension takes place, there
is no obligation for the cloud provider to suspend proportionally, for instance the applicable subservice, or user which
spreads illegal content

- That breach of the terms and conditions will entitle the SaaS provider to terminate for cause, even though the breach is
not “material”, and without you having a reasonable time to cure. And when termination happens, it will be “immediate”,
even when you will use months or years to replace the service with an alternate cloud offering

- Or if you are sued for infringement by a third party claiming that the use of the SaaS offering is infringing its right,
your cloud provider may merely terminate the cloud offering and refund any prepaid fees to you, without an obligation
for the cloud provider to use reasonable commercial efforts to resolve the issue rather than just terminating the
service you have spent much time and money to implement.

We have developed a cloud offering checklist that you may use as a tool when reviewing cloud terms and conditions from
various cloud providers, so you get control of your rights and obligations and possible identify areas which you should
try to negotiate. For businesses subject to sector specific rules and regulations, the check list includes overview of
such rules and regulations, and guidance on how to ensure/verify compliance when entering into cloud offerings.

“Its not possible to negotiate SaaS or license agreements” you may say. We register that many customers are of this
impression. It’s however wrong. Our experience that it is always possible to negotiate such T&C’s, even with the largest
international cloud providers. At least as long as you ensure that your potential provider understand that they have
competitors and that the “balance” of the T&Cs is a part of your evaluation. It is always possible to negotiate prices
and price lock for SaaS offerings. We are surprised how many customers we see these days, that for instance invest in
complex ERP solutions that cost several hundred million in external implementation cost, that have not secured the SaaS
price for more than 3 years. Such a situation just has to be avoided, because the SaaS subscription fees will be
increased exponentially after three years, unless you have agreed a renewal price or other type of indexation.
