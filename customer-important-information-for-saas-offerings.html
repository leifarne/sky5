<h1>Important information for SaaS offerings</h1>

<h3> When procuring SaaS solutions where the hosting of the application is done via a third party IaaS/PaaS cloud offering (such as AWS, GCP or Azure) it is very important to understand whether your SaaS agreement has the consequence that the “hosting part” of the SaaS offering is delivered as part of the SaaS agreement or whether a separate agreement will be considered established between you and the third party IaaS/PaaS cloud supplier.</h3>

<h2>Why is this important?</h2>

<p>If your SaaS provider has contracted with Azure, AWS or GCP in such a way that you do not need to accept the customer agreement/subscription terms from either Azure, AWS or GCP and thereby enter into a direct agreement with the applicable cloud provider, this means that you as a starting point only have to relate to your SaaS providers terms and conditions. Not having to accept Microsoft Customer Agreement or Amazon Customer agreement etc may seem appealing, as it will save you the “time and trouble” of having to read such terms and conditions and adhere to them. E.g. it may seem as a way to simplify the end-customers contract process.</p>

<blockquote>
However, in order for your SaaS provider to be allowed to use either Azure, AWS or GCP as its hosting platform when providing its SaaS offering to end customers like you, the SaaS provider need its own agreement which will authorize it to resell Azure, AWS or GCP as part of its SaaS offering, and it will normally be <i>“responsible for that end customers use are in accordance with the terms and conditions”</i> applicable to the SaaS provider. 
</blockquote> 

<h2>This has the following (not that obvious) consequences for you:</h2>
<p> - If you or any other end customer of the SaaS provider breaches (for instance the Acceptable Use Policy, Export control or Use Restrictions) the agreement between Azure, AWS or CCP and your SaaS provider, this will be considered a breach by your SaaS provider towards the applicable third party IaaS/PaaS cloud provider, and such cloud provider will normally be entitled to suspend and/or terminate the IaaS/PaaS-services towards your SaaS provider, and <u>all</u> of the other SaaS provider end customers including yourself. E.g one end customer’s failure <strong>may affect</strong> you and all other 999 customers. This means that this agreement model has a high risk from an end customer perspective, which you should assess carefully. For instance, if the SaaS solution is <strong>business critical</strong> for you, and the availability of the SaaS service rely on both your SaaS provider and <u>all</u> other end customers being compliant with the applicable cloud providers terms and conditions, you should assess whether you can take this risk or not.</p>

<p>Our recommendation is to at least ask your SaaS provider about possible mitigating actions taken in order to reduce the risk for such a situation. As the largest risk for breach of Azure, AWS and GCP terms and conditions, relates to breach of the <strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong> (which normally have prohibitions against illegal content, using the cloud services for illegal purposed, to spam and distribute malware etc), the <strong>Use Restrictions</strong> (don’t reengineer, work around technical limitations, impair the cloud suppliers IPR or share the online services with third parties etc), or the <strong>Export Control regulations</strong>, we recommend the following questions to the SaaS provider:</p>

<ul> 
    <li><strong>Export control</strong>: ask how they ensure that other end customers do not breach such regulations, are there for instance technical measures that will prevent use in countries which are on an embargo list? </li>
    <li><strong>Use restrictions</strong>; is the SaaS offering designed so that end customers have no possibility to reverse engineer the cloud supplier IaaS/PaaS services, has it been ensured that other end customers cannot share its SaaS offering with third parties that does not use it only for the purpose of the applicable end customers business purpose, and are normal security measures to prevent unauthorised access implemented?  </li>
    <li> <strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong>, in order to prevent end customers storing illegal content in Azure, content that infringes third party rights, using the online services for illegal purposed, to spam and distribute malware etc, is the solution designed so it’s not possible to do the above? </li>
</ul>
<p> - Without a direct agreement with the third-party IaaS/PaaS cloud provider, you normally do not get any protection from that SaaS provider for infringement claims from third parties, if related to the IaaS/PaaS services. For instance, only the “Customer” (your SaaS provider) is protected under the MS Customer Agreement “against third party claims”, not “third parties” if sued directly such as you as an end customer. Your SaaS provider may offer this in it’s owns terms and conditions, but often we see that third party services are excluded. This should be checked, and the potential risk should be assessed. From a legal perspective the risk is probably not high as the end customer does not host the software itself when subscribing to SaaS services, e.g does not make own copy of third party IPR. </p>
    <p> - Without a direct agreement with the third-party IaaS/PaaS cloud provider, no data processor agreement will be established between you and the applicable cloud provider. In order to be GDPR compliant you should therefor verify that 1) your data processing agreement with the SaaS provider list the relevant PaaS/IaaS supplier as a sub-processor, 2) that the DPA have implemented similar obligations including safeguards for the sub-processor as the SaaS provider has towards the end customer, ref the requirement in GDPR, 3), check if the sub-processor is approved under the data protection framework (EU/US) or that the necessary SCC is in place for non-approved US companies and subprocessors in all other countries and 4) request access to and asses your potential SaaS suppliers TIA (Transfer Impact Assessment) or risk assessment in accordance with GDPR article 32.</p>
<p> - Without a direct agreement with the third-party IaaS/PaaS cloud provider, you as an end Customers get no protection for any claims/fines due to breach of the privacy act from the third party IaaS/PaaS provider. You should assess whether your SaaS provider offers this protection after all. </p>

<h3>In order to avoid the above-mentioned risks, there is always the possibility to require that your SaaS provider enters into a resale model with either Azure, AWS or GCP, which has the effect that you as an end customer will have to accept the terms and conditions of either Azure, AWS or GCP as applicable, and a direct agreement is created between you and Azure, AWS or GCP as applicable. </h3>

<p>We assume that the reason why so many SaaS providers in the market use the hosting exception instead of becoming a CSP, is that under the “hosting exception” the Azure tenant will belong to the SaaS provider, and the end customers will not have one tenant each (multi-tenant). Then it is easier to establish a multitenant solution, keeping cost down when mass distributing updates to all end customers at once. On the other hand, most PaaS/IaaS suppliers also offers the possibility for SaaS suppliers to mass distribute updates, even if the tenant us end customer controlled.</p>
