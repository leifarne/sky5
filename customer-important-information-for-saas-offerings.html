<h1>Important information for SaaS offerings</h1>

<h3> When procuring SaaS solutions where the hosting of the application is done via a third party IaaS/PaaS cloud offering (such as AWS, GCP or Azure) it is very important to understand whether your SaaS agreement has the consequence that the “hosting part” of the SaaS offering is delivered as part of the SaaS agreement or whether a separate agreement will be considered established between you and the third party IaaS/PaaS cloud supplier.</h3>

<h2>Why is this important?</h2>

<p>If your SaaS provider has contracted with Azure, AWS or GCP in such a way that you do not need to accept the customer agreement/subscription terms from either Azure, AWS or GCP and thereby enter into a direct agreement with the applicable cloud provider, this means that you as a starting point only have to relate to your SaaS providers terms and conditions. Not having to accept Microsoft Customer Agreement or Amazon Customer agreement etc may seem appealing, as it will save you the “time and trouble” of having to read such terms and conditions and adhere to them. E.g. it may seem as a way to simplify the end-customers contract process.</p>

<blockquote>
However, in order for your SaaS provider to be allowed to use either Azure, AWS or GCP as its hosting platform when providing its SaaS offering to end customers like you, the SaaS provider need its own agreement which will authorize it to resell Azure, AWS or GCP as part of its SaaS offering, and it will normally be <i>“responsible for that end customers use are in accordance with the terms and conditions”</i> applicable to the SaaS provider. 
</blockquote> 

<h2>This has the following (not that obvious) consequences for you:</h2>
<p> -	If you or any other end customer of the SaaS provider breaches (for instance the Acceptable Use Policy, Export control or Use Restrictions) the agreement between Azure, AWS or CCP and your SaaS provider, this will be considered a breach by your SaaS provider towards the applicable third party IaaS/PaaS cloud provider, and such cloud provider will normally be entitled to suspend and/or terminate the IaaS/PaaS-services towards your SaaS provider, and <u>all</u> of the other SaaS provider end customers including yourself. E.g one end customer’s failure <strong>may affect</strong> you and all other 999 customers. This means that this agreement model has a high risk from an end customer perspective, which you should assess carefully. For instance, if the SaaS solution is <strong>business critical</strong> for you, and the availability of the SaaS service rely on both your SaaS provider and <u>all</u> other end customers being compliant with the applicable cloud providers terms and conditions, you should assess whether you can take this risk or not.</p>

<p>Our recommendation is to at least ask your SaaS provider about possible mitigating actions taken in order to reduce the risk for such a situation. As the largest risk for breach of Azure, AWS and GCP terms and conditions, relates to breach of the <strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong> (which normally have prohibitions against illegal content, using the cloud services for illegal purposed, to spam and distribute malware etc), the <strong>Use Restrictions</strong> (don’t reengineer, work around technical limitations, impair the cloud suppliers IPR or share the online services with third parties etc), or the <strong>Export Control regulations</strong>, we recommend the following questions to the SaaS provider:</p>
