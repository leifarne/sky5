<h1>Important information for SaaS offerings</h1>

<h3> When procuring SaaS solutions where the hosting of the application is done via a third party IaaS/PaaS cloud offering (such as AWS, GCP or Azure) it is very important to understand whether your SaaS agreement has the consequence that the “hosting part” of the SaaS offering is delivered as part of the SaaS agreement or whether a separate agreement will be considered established between you and the third party IaaS/PaaS cloud supplier.</h3>

<h2>Why is this important?</h2>

<p>If your SaaS provider has contracted with Azure, AWS or GCP in such a way that you do not need to accept the customer agreement/subscription terms from either Azure, AWS or GCP and thereby enter into a direct agreement with the applicable cloud provider, this means that you as a starting point only have to relate to your SaaS providers terms and conditions. Not having to accept Microsoft Customer Agreement or Amazon Customer agreement etc may seem appealing, as it will save you the “time and trouble” of having to read such terms and conditions and adhere to them. E.g. it may seem as a way to simplify the end-customers contract process.</p>

<blockquote>
However, in order for your SaaS provider to be allowed to use either Azure, AWS or GCP as its hosting platform when providing its SaaS offering to end customers like you, the SaaS provider need its own agreement which will authorize it to resell Azure, AWS or GCP as part of its SaaS offering, and it will normally be <strong>“responsible for that end customers use are in accordance with the terms and conditions” </strong> applicable to the SaaS provider.
